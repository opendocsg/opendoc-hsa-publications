## Chapter A - General Overview

### 1 FOREWORD

This guidance document outlines the regulatory processes and requirements for therapeutic product registration and should be read in conjunction with the relevant legislation in Singapore, including:

- Health Products Act (Cap. 122D); and
- Health Product (Therapeutic Products) Regulations 2016.

The Health Products Act (HPA) provides for the legislative basis for regulating the manufacture, import, supply, presentation and advertisement of therapeutic products, one of the health products categories regulated under the Act.

#### 1.1 Scope of This Guidance Document

This guidance document describes the procedures and requirements for submitting an application to register a therapeutic product, or to make a variation application to a registered therapeutic product.

Under the First Schedule of the HPA, a therapeutic product means any substance that:

> (a) is intended for use by and in humans for a therapeutic, preventive, palliative or diagnostic purpose, including any of the following purposes:

> > (i) for preventing, diagnosing, monitoring, treating, curing or alleviating any disease, disorder, ailment, injury, handicap or abnormal physical or mental state, or any symptom thereof;

> > (ii) for investigating, modifying, or replacing any physiological process;

> > (iii) for influencing, controlling or preventing conception; or

> > (iv) for inducing anaesthesia.

> (b) has as its constituent any of the following active ingredients:

> > (i) any chemical or botanical element, naturally occurring chemical or botanical material or chemical product obtained by chemical change or synthesis;

> > (ii) any metabolite from a micro-organism;

> > (iii) any macromolecule extracted from an organism; or

> > (iv) any substance derived from a biological system, including any of the following:

> > > (A) a whole cell or micro-organism, such as a whole virus or bacterium used as a vaccine;

> > > (B) a part of a micro-organism, such as a sub-unit vaccine;

> > > (C) a plasma-derived product; or

> > > (D) a biotechnology-derived substance, such as a protein or polypeptide;

> (c) exerts an inherent effect either pharmacologically, chemically or by other physiological means, leading to its use for a therapeutic preventive, palliative or diagnostic purpose; and

> (d) is not any of the following:

> > (i) a medical device;

> > (ii) any product containing human or animal cell or tissue;

> > (iii) any substance administered to humans with a view to regulating, repairing, replacing, adding or deleting a genetic sequence;

> > (iv) whole blood or any blood component;

> > (v) any Chinese proprietary medicine;

> > (vi) any homoeopathic medicine;

> > (vii) any medicated oil or balm;

> > (viii) any quasi-medicinal product; or

> > (ix) any traditional medicine.

To avoid doubts, items d(v), (vi), (vii), (viii) and (ix), have the same meaning as that under the Medicines Act (Cap. 176) as defined in paragraph 2 of the Medicines (Traditional Medicines, Homoeopathic Medicines & Other Substances) (Exemption) Order.

In making an application for a therapeutic product, applicants should ensure that the submission requirements as specified in this guidance document are duly fulfilled. In a situation where an applicant proposes an alternative to any of the specified requirements, such proposal should be accompanied by scientific justification and should be discussed with HSA prior to making the submission to avoid rejection of the application.

HSA may also request for additional information to supplement the specified submission requirements if deemed necessary for the assessment of the safety, efficacy and quality of the product for which an application is made.

Within this document, the term ‘quality’ may be used to describe chemical, pharmaceutical and biological data, while the term ‘non-clinical’ may be used to describe preclinical, pharmacological and toxicological data.

Applicants are advised to check HSA's website for the latest version of this guidance document and other related therapeutic product registration guidelines.

#### 1.2 Therapeutic Product Registration

A therapeutic product registered under the HPA is specific to the product with respect to its:
> - proprietary or brand name;
> - pharmaceutical formulation;
> - pharmaceutical dosage form (i.e. physical presentation) and strength; and
> - indication(s) and dosing regimen.

Different formulations, dosage forms and strengths of the same chemical or biologic entity are considered as different products and will require separate registrations for the individual product.

Forensic Classification
Upon satisfying the regulatory requirements for quality, safety and efficacy, a therapeutic product may be registered under one of the following forensic classifications, which determines the level of control for access:
> - Prescription-Only Medicine (POM);
> - Pharmacy-Only Medicine (P); or
> - General Sale List medicine (GSL).

Prescription-Only Medicines (POM) control is required in the following situations:

> (a) The product poses a direct^1 or indirect^2 danger to human health, even when used correctly, if used without medical supervision;

> (b) The product is frequently and widely used incorrectly and, as a result, is likely to present a direct or indirect danger to human health;

> (c) The product requires further investigation into its activity and/or side effects; or

> (d) The product is normally prescribed by a doctor or dentist to be administered parenterally.

The following also needs to be taken into consideration when deciding whether a product should be classified as a POM:
> (a) Whether the product contains a substance which is listed in either the Narcotic Drug Convention or the Psychotropic Substances Convention;

> (b) Whether the product is likely to lead to medicinal abuse or addiction if used incorrectly or to be used for illegal purposes;

> (c) Whether the product contains a substance which, by reason of its novelty or properties, has the potential to fall within point (b) above;

> (d) Whether the product, by reason of its pharmaceutical characteristics, is reserved for treatments which can only be administered in a hospital;

> (e) Whether the product is used in the treatment of conditions which must be diagnosed in a hospital or in an institution with special diagnostic facilities; or

> (f) Whether the product is intended for outpatients but may produce serious side effects, which would require medical supervision throughout the treatment.

Pharmacy-Only Medicines (P) control is required for products that possess characteristics which are not sufficiently critical to warrant POM control but for which the following apply:
> (a) Consultation with a pharmacist is necessary to confirm the appropriate choice of therapy;

> (b) The contraindications, drug interactions, precautions or warnings need reinforcement by a pharmacist or are not easily recognised by the purchaser; or

> (c) Special precaution is needed in the storage and handling of the product.

(^1) frequency^ Direct danger: Adverse reactions for which there is no preventive action or which are serious, severe or of high
(^2) Indirect danger: Masking of an underlying condition that requires medical attention e.g. cancer, heart disease

General Sale List Medicines (GSL) control is sufficient in the following situations:
> (a) The product is reasonably safe and can be sold or supplied without the need for supervision by a registered doctor, dentist or pharmacist;

> (b) The contraindications, drug interactions, precautions and warnings are easily recognised by the consumer; and

> (c) The hazard to health, the risk of misuse, the risk of misdiagnosis, or the need to take special precaution in the storage and handling the product is small.

### 2 APPLICANT RESPONSIBILITIES

The applicant of a product registration refers to the local company that is applying for the product registration. The applicant company may authorise officers, permanent employees, or designated external parties, all of whom are referred to as the “applicant representative”, to submit the application for product registration in Singapore.

According to Section 30(10) of the HPA, an applicant, in making an application for the registration of a therapeutic product, must ensure that all information contained in the application is truthful and is not misleading. An applicant must inform HSA of any emerging information that may affect the benefit-versus-risk assessment of the therapeutic product to which the application relates, as soon as the applicant becomes aware of such information.

The applicant is responsible for submitting the application and all the accompanying supporting documents (including but not limited to the dossier, responses to HSA’s queries and commitment letters).

HSA may require a statutory declaration by the applicant verifying any information
contain in or relating to the application.

### 3 WHETHER A THERAPEUTIC PRODUCT IS SUBJECT TO PATENT

An applicant for registration of a therapeutic product is required to make a declaration on whether the therapeutic product for which registration is sought is subject to a subsisting patent, pursuant to Regulation 23 of the Health Products (Therapeutic
Products) Regulations, hereafter referred to as the Regulations.

The declaration must be made in the form specified in Appendix 1 – Form 1 of this guidance document and furnished at the time of making the application, as well as at any other such time as HSA may require. A second declaration is required prior to the grant of registration.

A registration application may be declared as one of the following categories:
> - Category A1: where no patent is in force in respect of the therapeutic product to which the application relates;

> - Category A2: where a patent is in force in respect of the therapeutic product to which the application relates and the applicant is either the proprietor of the patent, or if the applicant is not the proprietor of the patent, the proprietor has consented to or acquiesced in the grant of the registration;

> - Category A3: where a patent is in force in respect of the therapeutic product to which the application relates, the applicant is not the proprietor of the patent and the proprietor has not consented to or acquiesced in the grant of the registration, and the applicant is requesting for the grant of registration after the patent expires. Such an application may not be made earlier than 18 months before the patent expires;

> - Category B: where a patent is in force in respect of the therapeutic product to which the application relates, the applicant is not the proprietor of the patent and the proprietor has not consented to or acquiesced in the grant of the registration, and in the applicant’s opinion and to the best of his belief the patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the performing of the act for which the registration is sought.

The person who is making the declaration must be duly authorised to act on behalf of the applicant. The authorised person is ordinarily an officer of the company such as a director, the company secretary as registered with ACRA, or equivalent. Evidence of such authorisation of such a person by the applicant must accompany the declaration at the point of submission. Examples of evidence of authorisation include a resolution of board of directors, a resolution of a general meeting of the company, or an extract of the relevant portion of the company’s articles of association. Declaration forms must bear the original signature of the authorised person.

Where an application is declared as a Category B application, HSA will require the applicant to serve a notice to the proprietor of the patent in the form specified in Annex 1 – Form 2 of this guidance document. An applicant may also be required to serve a
notice where HSA considers it appropriate.

The information contained in this section serves solely as guidance on the requirement for submission of declaration on patent status for the purpose of product registration. HSA does not provide advice on the category under which an application should be declared or whether a therapeutic product is subject to a subsisting patent. An applicant requiring such assistance should seek appropriate legal advice.

### 4 PROTECTION OF CONFIDENTIAL SUPPORTING INFORMATION AND REGISTRATION EXCLUSIVITY

Regulation 26 and 29 of the Regulations provide for protection of confidential supporting information relating to innovative therapeutic product applications and exclusivity of safety and efficacy data, respectively.

Confidential information received in support of the registration of an innovative therapeutic product is protected for a period of 5 years from the date of receipt, during which HSA will not use the information to determine whether to grant any other registration applications. In this regard, confidential supporting information refers to trade secrets and information that has commercial value that would be, or would likely to be, diminished by disclosure.

A 5-year period of exclusivity is granted for a therapeutic product for which safety and efficacy data has been generated in support of its registration. During the exclusivity period, a subsequent similar therapeutic product will not be able to rely on such data generated for the earlier therapeutic product to obtain registration.

## Chapter B - Registration Process

A company seeking to market a therapeutic product in Singapore must obtain marketing approval from HSA through making an application for product registration. The registration process involves a series of steps, as shown in Figure 1.

![Figure 1](/assets/figure_1.png)

Figure 1 Registration Process for a Therapeutic Product


### 5 PRE-SUBMISSION PREPARATION

The following are important considerations for an application to register a therapeutic product:
> (a) Knowing which type of application to apply for;

> (b) Knowing which evaluation route to choose; and

> (c) Arranging for a pre-submission consultation with HSA for advice, if required.

#### 5.1 Product Types

A therapeutic product could contain either chemical or biological entity(ies) as the active ingredient(s).

A chemical entity refers to any chemical element, naturally occurring chemical material or chemical product obtained by chemical change or synthesis (including macromolecules produced by chemical synthesis, such as peptides/oligo- nucleotides), or any metabolites from a micro-organism (such as antibiotics).

A biological entity refers to any macromolecule extracted from an organism (such as proteins, nucleic acids, proteoglycans, cytokines and growth factors), or any substance derived from a biological system, including any of the following: 
> (a) a whole cell or micro-organism, such as a whole virus or bacterium used as a vaccine;

> (b) a part of a micro-organism, such as a sub-unit vaccine;

> (c) a plasma-derived product; or

> (d) a biotechnology-derived substance, such as a protein or polypeptide.

#### 5.2 Application Types

In applying for a new product registration for a therapeutic product in Singapore, there are two categories of applications – a new drug application (NDA) and a generic drug application (GDA):

<u><b>NDA</b> New Drug Application</u>

##### NDA-1: 
> For the first strength of a product containing a new^3 chemical or biological entity.

##### NDA- 2 :
> (a) For the first strength of a product
> > (i) containing a new combination of registered chemical or biological entities;
> > (ii) containing registered chemical or biological entity(ies) in a new dosage form (e.g. tablets, capsules, injectables), new presentation (e.g. single-dose vials, multi-dose vials, pre-filled syringe) or new formulation (e.g. preservative-free);
> > (iii) containing registered chemical or biological entity(ies) for use by a new route of administration; or,
> > (iv) containing registered chemical or biological entity(ies) for new indication(s), dosage recommendation(s) and/or patient population(s).
> (b) For products that do not fall under the requirements for NDA- 1 , NDA- 3 or GDA.

##### NDA-3:

> For subsequent strength(s) of a product that has been registered or has been submitted as an NDA-1 or NDA-2. The product name, dosage form, indication, dosing regimen and patient population should be the same as that for the NDA-1 or NDA-2.

(^3)
the^ i.e. not a currently registered entity in Singapore. Register of Therapeutic Products at [http://www.hsa.gov.sg.](http://www.hsa.gov.sg.)^ Currently registered therapeutic products can be found in

<u><b>GDA</b> Generic Drug Application</u>

A generic drug application applies to a therapeutic product that contains one or more chemical entities, and that is essentially the same with a current registered product with respect to its qualitative and quantitative composition of active ingredients, pharmaceutical dosage form and clinical indication.

Follow-on biologic products (also known as biosimilar products) are not eligible for a GDA and are required to be submitted via a NDA.

##### GDA-1: 

> For the first strength of a generic chemical product.

##### GDA-2:

For subsequent strength(s) of the generic chemical product that has been registered or submitted as GDA-1. The product name and dosage form should be the same as that for the GDA-1.

In cases where multiple strengths of a generic product are submitted together, the strength of the product used in the BE study is considered as GDA-1. The remaining strength(s) should be submitted as GDA-2.

Figure 2 is a schematic diagram illustrating the various types of applications:

Figure 2 Schematic Diagram of Application Routes for Drug Registration

If there are doubts regarding which is the appropriate application type to choose, applicants are encouraged to consult HSA via the online feedback form on the HSA website prior to the submission of an application.

#### 5.3 Evaluation Routes

There are four types of evaluation routes for registering a new therapeutic product:

|||
|-|-|
|Full route:|Applies to any new product that has not been approved by any drug regulatory agency at the time of application submission to HSA.|
|Abridged route:| Applies to any new or generic product that has been evaluated and approved by at least one drug regulatory agency.|
|Verification route:| Applies to any new or generic product that has been evaluated and approved by HSA’s reference drug regulatory agencies, which include EMA^4 , US FDA, Health Canada, TGA and UK MHRA^5.|
|Verification-CECA route:| Applies to any generic product manufactured in India which has been evaluated and approved by HSA’s reference drug regulatory agencies, which include EMA^4 , US FDA, Health Canada, TGA and UK MHRA^5.|

Applicants should refer to Chapters C, D and E for detailed information about the selection of appropriate evaluation routes for NDA, GDA and Biosimilar product applications, respectively.

#### 5.4 Pre-Submission Consultation

Applicants are encouraged to contact HSA prior to the submission of an application if questions arise or clarification is required. There are two methods to contact HSA:

(^4) For products approved via the Centralised Procedure
(^5) For products approved via the national procedure or where^ MHRA acted as the RMS for the MRP or Decentralised Procedures in Europe

> (a) Pre-submission Enquiry via the online feedback form on the HSA website; and
> (b) Pre-submission Meeting/ Notification

A Pre-submission meeting is generally advisable if there are uncertainties on the eligibility for an application type, evaluation route, or whether the application dossier adequately fulfils the specified submission requirements. Advice given at pre- submission meetings will be based on information current at the time of the consultation and have no bearing on the eventual outcome of the application concerned.

##### 5.4.1 Pre-Submission Enquiry

An applicant may submit a Pre-Submission Enquiry via the online feedback form on the HSA website to clarify any matters concerning the application prior to submission. The enquiry type selected should be “Therapeutic Product Registration” to minimise delays in the processing of the enquiry.

##### 5.4.2 Pre-Submission Meeting/ Notification

An applicant may request for a pre-submission meeting if a face-to-face consultation with HSA is necessary to address specific submission issues. The request should be made in writing, stating the purpose, agenda and proposed date and time for the meeting, via the online feedback form on the HSA website. 

The meeting request should be made at least 3 weeks prior to the meeting date, and relevant meeting documents (e.g. presentation slides, briefing documents, etc.) should be provided at least 1 week before the meeting.

A pre-submission meeting is not compulsory for an application filed via the full evaluation route. Nonetheless, the applicant is required to notify HSA at least two months prior to the intended submission date. The notification can be sent via the online feedback form on the HSA website, and should include information on the product name (if available), active ingredient(s), summaries of the quality, non- clinical and clinical data (e.g. Overviews), planned submissions in other countries, and planned date of submission to HSA.

### 6 APPLICATION SUBMISSION

The submission of an application comprises two key steps – (i) online submission of the application form via PRISM and (ii) submission of the technical dossier.

#### 6.1 PRISM Application Form

All applications must be made online via PRISM. Please refer to Appendix 17 Guideline on PRISM submission for further details.

#### 6.2 Application Dossier

The technical dossier accompanying the application should be submitted within 2 working days of the PRISM application submission to prevent delays in the processing of the application. The date of receipt of the actual technical dossier by HSA will be taken as the submission date where the processing time starts.

Application dossiers should be organised in a CTD format. The CTD provides a common format for the preparation of a well-structured submission dossier. It uses a modular framework described in ICH Topic M4 or the ASEAN guidelines on the Common Technical Document for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human use: Organisation of the Dossier. This guidance document should be read in conjunction with the current version of the ICH CTD and the ASEAN CTD (ACTD) guidance documents.

Either the ICH CTD or the ACTD format is acceptable for making a submission to HSA. Table 1 summarises the organisation of the respective format:

Table 1 Format of the ICH CTD and ACTD

|Documents| Location in|Location in|
|-|-|
|ICH| CTD| ACTD|
|Administrative Documents and Product Information|Module 1| Part I|
|Common Technical Document Overview and Summaries|Module 2| Incorporated in Parts II, III and IV|
|Quality documents| Module 3| Part II|
|Non-clinical documents| Module 4| Part III|
|Clinical documents |Module 5| Part IV|

Application checklists for both ICH CTD and ACTD dossiers are provided in Appendix 2A and 3A, respectively, to guide applicants on the submission requirements and to ensure completeness of the dossier. Each application must be accompanied by a checklist duly completed by the applicant and attached in PRISM.

Applicants should note that the CTD format cannot be changed once the application is submitted. Any subsequent variation applications for the product should follow the same format.

##### 6.2.1 Submission Requirements

The complete application dossier – i.e. Modules 1 to 5 of the ICH CTD or Parts I to IV of the ACTD – must be submitted in an electronic format.

All documents required under Module 1/Part I must be submitted in softcopy in PRISM. Colour scanned copy of the original documents should be submitted and original hardcopy of documents are not required. However, HSA reserves the rights to request for the submission of the original or certified true copy of the submitted document if there is any doubt that the submitted scanned document is not an accurate reflection of the original document.

Please refer to section 6.2.3 for more information on certifying non-original documents if the original documents cannot be provided.

For Modules 2 to 5/Parts II to IV, applicants can opt to attach the documents either in full into PRISM section 7 (Supporting Attachments) or submit the softcopies (e.g. PDF format) in a CD/DVD.

**Submitting a CD or DVD**
When submitting a CD/DVD, applicants are encouraged to organise the dossier (i.e. folders and subfolders) according to the CTD format and to include bookmarks in all documents to facilitate the retrieval of documents.

Files containing the below scripts will not be accepted due to cybersecurity reasons:

The CD/DVD should be properly labelled with the following information:
> - PRISM application number;
> - PRISM submission date;
> - Product name;
> - Application type; and
> - Contents of the CD/DVD (e.g. Module 2, 3 and 5).

Applicants must ensure the access to the content of CD/DVD. For protected files, password(s) must be provided as appropriate.

Upon acceptance of the application for evaluation, applicants will be notified if additional copies of clinical documents (in CD/DVD) will be required.

##### 6.2.2 Language and Translation

All documents submitted in support of an application to HSA must be in English. For documents in their original language which is not English, a certified translation or a verified translation may be acceptable.


##### 6.2.3 Certifying Non-Original Documents

If the softcopy official document (e.g. CPP, GMP certificate, etc.) submitted to HSA in PRISM is not a scan of the original document, the document must be certified prior to submission. A certified true copy certifies that the photocopy presented is a true and accurate copy of the original document. Acceptable certification of documents to support therapeutic product applications to HSA can be done by the Company Director or Company Secretary as registered with ACRA or above, or by an independent authority such as a lawyer, notary public, Commissioner for Oaths/Declarations/Affidavits, Justice of Peace, the original issuer of the document or Embassy/Consulate. A notarised and authenticated copy is the same as a certified true copy.

A certified true copy of approval letters requires certification by the drug regulatory agency that issued the approval letter, a notary public or the Singapore Embassy/Consulate in the country where the approval letter was issued. Certification of approval letters is not required in the event the approval letter is available on the drug regulatory agency’s website. In this instance, applicants can provide the internet address (URL) for validation by HSA.

### 7 APPLICATION SCREENING

Following a submission made via PRISM and the receipt of the application dossier by HSA, the application will be screened to ensure the correctness of the application type and the completeness of the dossier. The date of receipt of the application dossier (i.e. the technical dossier [e.g. in a CD/DVD] including the application checklist) will be taken as the submission date and the start of the screening timeline.

During screening, if an application is identified to be more appropriately submitted under a different application type, the applicant will be informed of this change and 

the necessary actions to effect this change via an Input Request. More information on the change in application type is described in section 12.2.1 Changes to Application Types and Re-routing of Evaluation During Screening.

For applications with the following major deficiencies, the applicant will be requested to withdraw the application, as screening cannot proceed without the dossier:
> - entire dossier sections not submitted (drug substance, drug product, clinical);
> - Drug Master File (DMF) not submitted (where applicable); or
> - assessment reports not submitted (for verification route).

Applicants should ensure that the dossier is compiled according to the required format. Failure to adhere to the required CTD format will lead to the non-acceptance of the dossier without screening.

If deficiencies are identified in an application dossier, a screening query stating the deficiencies will be issued via Input Request to the applicant. The stop-clock starts when an Input Request is sent and ends upon receipt of a complete and satisfactory response to the query. The total number of Input Requests sent during screening is capped at two. Applicants will be given 20 working days to respond to each Input Request, starting from the date the Input Request is sent.

The application will only be accepted when all deficiencies have been adequately addressed and HSA is satisfied that the dossier is complete for evaluation. An acceptance notice will then be issued via PRISM and the date of acceptance of the application will be taken as the start of the evaluation timeline. For full and abridged applications, applicants will be required to submit additional copies of the dossier in CD/DVD format after acceptance.

If the applicant fails to address the deficiencies raised during screening, the application will not be accepted for evaluation. An Input Request will be issued to the applicant to withdraw the application. If the application is subsequently re-submitted, it will be processed as a new application.

```
NOTE: The screening process only checks for the completeness of the application dossier for evaluation. The acceptance of the dossier for evaluation does not denote the adequacy of the data for regulatory approval.
```

### 8 APPLICATION EVALUATION

Once the application is accepted, the evaluation stage begins. Evaluation queries
may be issued via Input Request to the applicant if clarification or additional
information is required.

The stop-clock starts whenever HSA issues a query and ends upon the receipt of a
complete and satisfactory response from the applicant.

In situations where the applicant is unable to provide a complete response within
the specified timeframe, the applicant should notify HSA as soon as possible after
receiving HSA’s queries. The application will be considered withdrawn if the
applicant fails to observe the specified response deadline.

Applicants are reminded that the submission of additional supporting data not
requested by HSA following the acceptance of the application will not be
considered, unless prior arrangement with HSA is made for the submission
concerned. During the evaluation process, HSA may assess that the application is
more suitably evaluated via an alternative route, in which case the application will
be re-routed to the appropriate route. Any re-routing of the application will be
discussed with the applicant.

HSA may engage external evaluators, experts and advisory committees in the
evaluation process, when necessary. These experts include scientists and
clinicians from both local and overseas institutions. All external evaluators and
experts are bound by agreement to protect the information made available to them.
The identity of the external evaluators is kept confidential.

```
NOTE: The screening process only checks for the completeness of the application
dossier for evaluation. The acceptance of the dossier for evaluation does not denote the
adequacy of the data for regulatory approval.
```

#### 8.1 Evaluation Stages

The progress status of the evaluation is available for certain application types and
evaluation routes. Table 2 describes the applicable product applications and the
stages of the evaluation:

**Table 2 Product Applications Applicable for Notification of Stages During Evaluation**

Applicants may view the evaluation stage via Track@PRISM. The following
screenshots illustrate the change in stages of a pending application:

Applicants are also notified via system-generated emails whenever an evaluation
stage change occurs.

### 9 REGULATORY DECISION

A regulatory decision is made following the conclusion of the benefit-risk
assessment by HSA based on the data submitted in support of the application.
Applicants will be notified of one of the following outcomes:

```
Enter PRISM application to
view stage of evaluation.
```
```
Choose these options from
the drop-down lists.
```
```
Active Evaluation^
The evaluation stage
is seen here.
```

- Approval – the application satisfies the registration requirements for quality,
safety and efficacy;
- Approvable – when the application can be approved subject to adequate
response to minor deficiencies;
- Non-approvable – when the application has major deficiencies; or
- Rejection – when the response provided by the applicant fails to address the
major deficiencies specified in HSA’s non-approvable decision.

‘Approval’ and ‘rejection’ are final decisions issued by HSA.

For an ‘approvable’ application, the applicant will be informed of the conditions for
approval and is required to fulfil these conditions within a stipulated timeframe prior
to the grant of a final approval.

For a ‘non-approvable’ application, the applicant will be informed of the deficiencies
leading to the non-approvable decision. If the applicant wishes to address the
specified deficiencies, the response should be based on the original data set
submitted to HSA and furnished within the stipulated timeframe. New data not
previously reviewed by HSA during the evaluation of the application concerned will
not be accepted.

An application will be considered withdrawn if the applicant fails to reply within the
stipulated timeframe subsequent to an ‘approvable’ or a ‘non-approvable’ decision.
Once the application is withdrawn, it is considered closed and the applicant will be
required to make a new application if he wishes to pursue the regulatory approval
for the product concerned.

Upon an ‘approval’ regulatory decision, the product will be added to the Register of
Therapeutic Products.

HSA may register the product subject to post-approval commitments. In such
circumstances, the applicant will be required to furnish a letter of commitment
stating the undertakings concerned.


Applicants must take note of the registration conditions and the post-approval
commitments specified in the registration. The registration conditions can be viewed
at Enquire@PRISM.

### 10 POST-APPROVAL CHANGES

Upon the registration of a product, product registrants are responsible for ensuring
the product’s quality, efficacy and safety through its life cycle.

HSA must be notified of any changes to the product’s quality, efficacy and safety
as per Chapter F of this guidance.

### 11 TARGET PROCESSING TIMELINES

Please refer to Appendix 5 for information on target processing timelines for the
different application types and evaluation routes.

### 12 FEES

As the fees may be subject to revision from time to time, applicants are advised to
visit the HSA website for updated information on fees^.

Payment can be made via GIRO or other electronic payment modes such as eNets
or eCredit card.

#### 12.1 Screening Fee

A screening fee is payable at the time of online submission via PRISM and is non-
refundable once the application is submitted via PRISM.

For payment via GIRO, the screening fee will be debited upon the successful
submission of an online application.

```
NOTE: Applicants are strongly encouraged to apply for a GIRO account (click here for
GIRO application form) with HSA to facilitate payments for future submissions and
subsequent payment for retention fee for the registered products.
```

For payment via other electronic payment modes (i.e. eNETs or eCredit card), the
screening fee must be paid before the application is considered successfully
submitted online.

#### 12.2 Evaluation Fee

An evaluation fee is payable upon the acceptance of the dossier for evaluation and
is non-refundable once the application is accepted.

For payments via GIRO, the evaluation fee will be debited upon the acceptance of
the application.

For payments via other electronic payment modes (i.e. eNETs or eCredit card), the
evaluation fee will be collected together with the screening fee. In the event that the
application is not accepted for evaluation, the fee collected will be refunded to the
applicant’s bank account.

Applicants may opt for the progressive payment scheme. This is an opt-in scheme
eligible for applicants who make payment via GIRO and is only applicable to the
application types listed in Table 3 :

Once the application is submitted, the selected payment scheme (full or
progressive) cannot be amended. Applicants who wish to change their selected
payment scheme will have to withdraw and re-submit the application(s); and any
upfront payment made (e.g. screening fee) are non-refundable.

For applications under the progressive payment scheme, in the event that the
application is withdrawn during the evaluation stage, any fees that had been
charged, but not debited from the GIRO account would remain payable. Any paid
fee is non-refundable.

12.2.1 Changes to Application Types and Re-routing of Evaluation During
Screening

If an application type or evaluation route is incorrectly selected, applicants will be
informed via an Input Request. Such changes may result in a different evaluation
fee upon acceptance of the application.

In the situation where the applicant decides not to pursue the application due to the
said changes, the screening fee is not refundable.

For applications which require withdrawal and resubmission, the screening fee is
not refundable. Applicants may wish to seek clarification on the appropriate
application type or evaluation route via the online feedback form on the HSA
website prior to the submission.

12.2.1.1 Change of Sub-Type within the Same Application Type

This refers to a change in the sub-type of the selected application type (e.g. from
NDA-1 to NDA-2, NDA-2 to NDA-3, or GDA-1 to GDA-2).

The applicant will be informed of the change via an Input Request. However,
applicants should not amend the application type field in the PRISM application
form. The change will be effected by HSA at the point of acceptance of the
application.


In the situation where the applicant decides not to pursue the application due to the
said change, the applicant must withdraw the application prior to acceptance to
avoid the evaluation fee being charged.

12.2.1.2 Change of Application between Different Application Types

This refers to a change in the application type between GDA to NDA or vice versa.

The applicant will be required to withdraw and resubmit the application if the
applicant intends to pursue the application.

12.2.1.3 Change of Evaluation Route

This refers to a change in evaluation route (e.g. Full to Abridged, Verification to
Abridged, Abridged to Verification, etc.).

The applicant will be required to withdraw and resubmit the application if the
applicant intends to pursue the application.


## Chapter C - New Drug Application Submission

This chapter applies to new drug applications for products containing new chemical
and biological entities. Applicants are advised to refer to Chapter E for new drug
applications for biosimilar products.

```
(^6)
i.e. not a currently registered entity in Singapore.


### 14 EVALUATION ROUTES

There are three evaluation routes for an NDA – full, abridged and verification
evaluation routes. The eligibility criteria are different for each evaluation route.
Applicants should be familiar with the criteria for each evaluation route because
each route has different documentary requirements.

Figure 3 is a schematic diagram illustrating the evaluation routes for NDAs:

#### 14.1 Full Evaluation Route

Full evaluation applies to a product that has not been approved by any drug
regulatory agency at the time of submission.

For a submission under the full evaluation route, the applicant is required to notify
HSA via the online feedback form on the HSA website at least two months prior to
the intended submission date of the application dossier. The notification should
include information on the product name (if available), active ingredient(s),
summaries of the quality, non-clinical and clinical data (e.g. Module 2.4 Non-clinical
Overview, Module 2.5 Clinical Overview), planned submissions in other countries,
and the planned date of submission to HSA.

#### 14.2 Abridged Evaluation Route

Abridged evaluation applies to a product that has been approved by at least one
drug regulatory agency at the time of submission.

##### 14.2.1 Priority Review

For NDAs submitted via the abridged evaluation route, the applicant may request
for priority review for a life-saving drug if there are unmet medical needs. The
following are the criteria that will be considered for granting a priority review:

(a) The drug is intended for the treatment of a serious life-threatening condition and
demonstrates the potential to address local unmet medical needs, as defined
by:
(i) the absence of a treatment option; or
(ii) the lack of safe and effective alternative treatments, such that the drug would
be a significant improvement compared to available marketed products, as
demonstrated by
(A) evidence of increased effectiveness in treatment, prevention, or
diagnosis;
or
(B) elimination or a substantial reduction of a treatment-limiting drug
reaction.

(b) Disease conditions that are of local public health concern will be given primary
consideration for priority review. Currently these include:
(i) cancer; and
(ii) infectious diseases: dengue, tuberculosis, hepatitis and malaria.

The request for priority review should be made at the point of the application
submission and accompanied by justifications (attached in PRISM; see section 15.1

- Introduction (CTD/PRISM section 1.3)) for requesting for a priority review and how
the product is expected to benefit patients, as substantiated by the following
evidence:
- The seriousness of the disease condition, local and worldwide mortality rates,
    anticipated morbidity and debilitation as a consequence of the disease;
- Local epidemiology data and volume of requests through the exemption route
    on a named-patient basis;
- The unmet needs, current available treatment options and standard therapies,
    and the inadequacy of current therapies;


- The extent to which the product is expected to have a major impact on medical
practice, its major benefit, and how it addresses the unmet needs; and
- Clinical evidence supporting the claims of significant improvement compared to
available treatments.

HSA reserves the right to deny a request for priority review if it is deemed
appropriate. The decision for the granting of priority review would be conveyed to
the applicant at the point of acceptance of the application for evaluation.

#### 14.3 Verification Evaluation Route

Therapeutic products with similar indication(s), dosing regimen(s), patient group(s),
and/or direction(s) for use that have been approved by at least two of HSA’s
reference drug regulatory agencies may be submitted via the verification evaluation
route. HSA’s reference drug regulatory agencies are:

- Australia Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA);
- Health Canada (HC);
- US Food and Drug Administration (FDA);
- European Medicines Agency (EMA) via the Centralised Procedure; and
- UK Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (UK MHRA) via

- the national procedure, or
- as the Reference Member State (RMS) via the Mutual Recognition
    Procedure or Decentralised Procedure.

However, approval by these reference drug regulatory agencies does not oblige
HSA to approve the application. HSA may also re-categorise applications to other
evaluation routes if deemed appropriate.

One of the reference drug regulatory agencies must be declared as the primary
reference agency. The chosen primary reference agency is defined as the
reference drug regulatory agency from which the qualifying supporting documents
(as outlined in this guidance) will be submitted.

Additional eligibility criteria for the verification route include:


- The application must be submitted to HSA within three years from the date of
approval by the chosen primary reference agency;
- A declaration letter issued by the product owner/applicant must be provided
stating that all aspects of the drug product’s quality, including but not limited to
the formulation, manufacturing site(s), release and shelf life specifications and
primary packaging, are identical to that currently approved by the chosen
primary reference agency at the time of submission. However, a different
container closure system type (e.g. Alu/Alu blister vs. HDPE bottle) may be
proposed to meet ASEAN stability requirements;
- If a Drug Master File is submitted, then a separate declaration letter issued by
the applicant must also be provided to state that the DMF submitted to HSA is
identical to that submitted to the chosen primary reference agency;
- The product does not need a more stringent assessment as a result of
differences in local disease patterns and/or medical practices (e.g. some anti-
infectives);
- The product and its intended use – i.e. indication(s), dosing regimen(s) and
patient group(s) – have not been rejected, withdrawn, or approved via appeal
process or are not pending deferral by a drug regulatory agency for safety and/or
efficacy reasons; and
- The product is not a biological product.

The proposed indication(s), dosing regimen(s), patient group(s) and/or direction(s)
for use should be the most stringent among those approved by the reference drug
regulatory agencies. In the event that the chosen primary reference agency does
not bear the most stringent indication(s), dosing regimen(s), patient group(s) and/or
direction(s) of use, the clinical assessment report from the reference drug regulatory
agency that does meet these requirements should be submitted. Reports from the
public domain are acceptable. The proposed PI/PIL should be identical to that
approved by this reference drug regulatory agency (with the exception of country-
specific information).

For a product with a proposed indication that has been designated as an Orphan
Drug by at least one reference drug regulatory agency or a product that has been
approved by at least one reference drug regulatory agency via an accelerated/fast-


```
track approval, approval under exceptional circumstances or equivalent approval
process, the applicant should consult HSA on the eligibility of such a product
through the verification route prior to its submission.
```
##### 14.3.1 NDA-3 Applications

```
For the NDA-3 application type, the verification evaluation route may be applied to
the registration of subsequent strengths of a currently-registered product in
Singapore. To qualify for the verification evaluation route for an NDA-3 application:
- if the product has been evaluated and approved by at least one of HSA’s
reference drug regulatory agencies, then the NDA-3 must be submitted within
two years from the date of approval by that reference drug regulatory agency;
or
- if the product has been evaluated and approved by at least two of HSA’s
reference drug regulatory agencies, then the NDA-3 must be submitted within
three years from the date of approval by the chosen primary reference agency.
```
```
All other eligibility criteria for the verification evaluation route as stated in section
14 .3 above will apply to NDA-3 applications except for the following:
- The proposed indication(s), dosing regimen(s), patient group(s), and/or
direction(s) for use must be identical to the corresponding approved NDA- 1
and/or NDA-2 product(s); and
- The proposed PI/PIL should also be consistent with that currently approved for
the corresponding NDA-1 and/or NDA-2 product(s).

Approved SPC/PI/PIL (CTD/PRISM section 1.5)
In this section, the applicant should submit the following:
(a) the approved SPC, PI and/or PIL from the drug regulatory agency that issued
the proof of approval; and
(b) the approved SPC, PI and/or PIL from all of HSA’s reference drug regulatory
agencies, where applicable.

The country from which the submitted SPC, PI and/or PIL originates should be
appropriately indicated (e.g. in the document file name).

Assessment Report from Reference Agencies (CTD/PRISM section 1.6)
This section refers only to applications submitted under the verification evaluation
route. Assessment reports and supporting documents issued by the primary
reference agency and inserted into this section must be unredacted and unedited.
Applicants should refer to section 15.6.3 for specific details on the required
documents.

Description of Batch Numbering System (CTD/PRISM section 1.7)
Detailed information on the system of assigning unique codes to different
production batches of the product should be provided to allow for batch
identification. Where applicable, examples of the batch numbering system should
be included to illustrate how the batch number enables identification.

Proof of Approval (CTD/PRISM sections 1.8, 1.9)
Proof of approval is not required for NDAs undergoing a full evaluation.

For an abridged evaluation of an NDA, proof of approval from any drug regulatory
agency is required. Proof of approval must come in the form of:
- an official approval letter, or equivalent document (e.g. Certificate of
Pharmaceutical Product; CPP), which certifies the registration status of the drug
product; and


- the SPC, PI and/or PIL approved by the drug regulatory agency that issued the
approval letter.

For a verification evaluation of an NDA, proof of approval from at least two (or at
least one or two for NDA-3, depending on the eligibility criteria stated in section
14 .3.1 NDA-3 Applications) of HSA’s reference drug regulatory agencies, including
the chosen primary reference agency, is required. Proof of approval must come in
the form of:
- an official approval letter, or equivalent document (e.g. Certificate of
Pharmaceutical Product; CPP), which certifies the registration status of the drug
product; and
- the SPC, PI and/or PIL approved by the drug regulatory agency that issued the
approval letter.

If the SPC is in a non-English language, applicants should refer to section 6.2.2
Language and Translation for more information on acceptable translations.

Note that all aspects of the product’s quality and intended direction(s) for use in
Singapore should be the same as those approved by the drug regulatory agency
that issued the approval letter.

Certificate of Pharmaceutical Product (CPP) should be valid at the time of
submission and should comply with WHO format (refer to Model certificate of a
pharmaceutical product). It is not required for information such as the product
formula, manufacturing sites, etc. to be reflected on the CPP, but if such information
are present in the CPP, the information should be consistent with that proposed for
the Singapore market. Note that CPPs that indicate that the product is not licensed
in the exporting country (including scenario where the product is licensed for “solely
for export only”) are not acceptable proof of approval.

Approval letters should either be an original copy or a certified true copy and in
English. Applicants should refer to sections 6.2.2 Language and Translation and
6.2.3 Certifying Non-Original Documents for more details. Reference to drug
regulatory authority websites in the form of website screenshot and URL (for the


website) for confirmation of the approval status of the products by that regulatory
authority are acceptable, provided that the product’s identity and product’s
ownership can be confirmed from that website.

HSA reserves the right to request for a Certificate of Pharmaceutical Product (CPP),
if deemed appropriate.

If the brand name (trade name) of the product registered in the country which issued
the proof of approval is different from that proposed in Singapore, the applicant is
required to submit a declaration letter from the product owner to declare that both
products marketed under the different brand names are identical in all aspects of
quality, safety and efficacy except for the brand name.

Authorisation Letters (CTD/PRISM section 1.10)
All submitted authorisation letters should be on the authorising company’s (i.e.
product owner’s) letterhead, dated and signed by the designated authorised person
in the company.

If the product owner is not the local applicant, manufacturer and/or batch releaser;
or the product owner’s address is different from that of the local applicant,
manufacturer and/or batch releaser, then the following authorisation letter(s) must
be submitted:

(a) from Product Owner to the Applicant (Company) (1.10.1) – this letter authorises
the local applicant to apply for and be the product registrant for a specific
therapeutic product (product name to be stated as in PRISM) and be responsible
for all matters pertaining to the registration of this product in Singapore.

(b) from Product Owner to Manufacturer (1.10.2) – this letter authorises the
specified manufacturer to produce, pack and/or label the drug product intended
for Singapore. If there are multiple drug product manufacturers, then the
applicant may opt to submit one authorisation letter which clearly states all of
the manufacturers (names and addresses) and their responsibilities relating to
the drug product (such as the manufacturing operation of each manufacturer in
relation to the product being submitted). For biologic drug products, an additional


```
authorisation letter from the product owner to the drug substance manufacturer
is required.
```
(c) from Product Owner to Batch Releaser (1.10.3) – this letter authorises the
specified company to batch release the drug product. If there are multiple sites
responsible for the batch release of the product, then the applicant may opt to
submit one authorisation letter which clearly states all of the batch releasers
(names and addresses) and their responsibilities.

The applicant may also issue an authorisation letter to authorise the specified
secondary packager located in Singapore to pack and/or label the drug product
intended for Singapore.

Applicants are to ensure that all names and addresses in the authorisation letters
are consistent with the information provided in PRISM and the dossier. For
manufacturers and batch releasers, the actual site address of the named company
should be stated in the letter(s) – i.e. do not state the office address. Any
discrepancy found will delay the registration process.

All authorisation letters should also state specific product details, including the
product name, dosage form and strength as stated in the PRISM application form.

Applicants also have the option to combine the authorisation letters as stated above
into one document, provided that all names, addresses and responsibilities are
clearly stated.

GMP Certification/Proof of GMP Compliance (CTD/PRISM section 1.11)
Documentary evidence must be provided to certify that the manufacturer(s)
complies with current applicable GMP standards. Applicants must submit a GMP
certificate issued by a drug regulatory agency for all drug product manufacturing
sites including, but not limited to, bulk product manufacturers, primary packagers
and secondary packagers.

A CPP may be submitted in lieu of a GMP certificate provided that the
manufacturer’s name(s) and address(es) is(are) stated on the CPP and the CPP


states that the certifying authority conducts periodic inspection of the manufacturing
plant in which the dosage form is produced. Applicants should note that the names
and addresses of all manufacturers should be consistent throughout the application

- i.e. GMP certificate, Letter of Authorisation, CTD sections S2.1 and P3.1 and
PRISM.

EudraGMP, the database of the European Community of manufacturing
authorisations and of certificates of good manufacturing practice, is an acceptable
alternative proof of GMP compliance in lieu of a GMP certification. Applicants
making reference to the EudraGMP as the proof of GMP compliance should provide
a screen capture of the EudraGMP website for the specific finished product
manufacturing site, as well as the URL to the website.

Certain accreditation documents/certificates issued by other drug regulatory
agencies (for example, Japan/PMDA Accreditation Certificate of Foreign Drug
Manufacturer, US/FDA Establishment Licence, Canada/Health Canada
Establishment Licence) are not acceptable proof of GMP compliance.

Proof of GMP compliance must be valid at the time of submission to HSA and must
be in English. Applicants should refer to section 6.2.2 Language and Translation.

If the submitted proof of GMP compliance is no longer valid or has less than 1
month’s validity at the time of acceptance of the application for evaluation, HSA
reserves the right to request for a commitment letter from the applicant to submit
an updated and valid proof of GMP compliance by a specified date post-
acceptance.

It should be noted that diluents used for reconstituting the drug product and are
packaged together with the drug product will be considered as part of the final drug
product. Thus, manufacturer(s) of the supplied diluent(s) must follow the same
requirements applicable to the drug product, e.g. provide proof of GMP compliance.

For biologic NDA applications, proof of GMP compliance for the drug substance
must be submitted in addition to the aforementioned GMP requirements.


For products manufactured in the USA or Canada, if the applicant is unable to
obtain any proof of GMP compliance (in the form of a CPP or GMP certificate) from
either US FDA/Health Canada or other drug regulatory agencies, the applicant is
required to submit the latest Establishment Inspection Report (EIR) issued by US
FDA or Inspection Exit Notice issued by Health Canada, and any other relevant
supporting documents^7 as proof of GMP compliance. The applicant is also required
to provide the following information if not found in the inspection reports:

- the last date of audit by US FDA/Health Canada;
- the approved dosage forms;
- any licensing conditions or restrictions;
- the scope of the inspection; and/or
- objective evidence and the date of a satisfactory close-out of the latest
inspection conducted by US FDA/Health Canada.

For products manufactured in Switzerland, if the applicant is unable to obtain any
proof of GMP compliance (in the form of a CPP or GMP certificate) from either
SwissMedic or other drug regulatory agencies, the Manufacturer’s Licence issued
by SwissMedic is an acceptable documentary GMP evidence.

If the drug product is manufactured by a new overseas drug product
manufacturing site not previously registered with HSA before 1st April 2004,
a GMP Conformity Assessment will be conducted by HSA. Thus, when applicable,
applicants must also submit the application form to request for GMP Evidence
Evaluation or for an Overseas GMP Audit with the required documents to the
Therapeutic Products Branch (as part of the product registration application) as
stipulated in the Guidance Notes on GMP Conformity Assessment of an Overseas
Manufacturer.

In general, a GMP Conformity Assessment is applicable to each specific
manufacturer, dosage form, manufacturing activities and applicant company. This
also includes contract manufacturers who perform certain manufacturing activities,

(^7)
signed by an official of th^ Any other supporting document which declares GMP compliance of the manufacturing site in the US and e US FDA.


such as terminal sterilisation of the drug product, mixing of excipient with drug
substance (drug product intermediate), etc.

In general, applicant companies with active product registration that included the
finished product manufacturer(s) performing the same manufacturing activities
(excluding parametric release) for the same dosage form would not be required to
undergo another GMP Conformity Assessment by HSA when they submit a new
product application which included the same finished product manufacturer(s).

For drug product manufacturing sites that use parametric release (e.g. where a
terminally sterilised product is released based on the review of manufacturing
process data instead of sterility testing), a GMP Conformity Assessment is required
for overseas drug product manufacturers. Eligibility criteria for such applications for
overseas manufacturing sites are:
a) Country of origin must be a PIC/S country; and
b) Parametric release is approved by the local authority.

If the above criteria are met, then approval letter and recent documentary evidence
of approval status (e.g. GMP Certificate) for parametric release issued by the local
authority should be provided. The manufacturing site and the product proposed for
parametric release should be clearly stated on these documents.

For a local manufacturing site that would like to apply for parametric release,
applicants are advised to contact HSA prior to submission as pre-approval
inspection is required.

HSA reserves the right to request for a GMP Conformity Assessment if deemed
necessary, or to request for additional or updated documents as evidence of GMP
compliance during the course of the registration process. HSA also reserves the
right to conduct an audit of any overseas manufacturer irrespective of the
documentary GMP evidence that is approved by HSA or any other PIC/S member
authorities, if deemed appropriate.


If in doubt whether a GMP Conformity Assessment by HSA is required for the
manufacturing sites included in the submission, applicants are encouraged to
complete and submit applications to request for GMP Conformity Assessment with
the product registration application, and HSA will advise accordingly whether the
GMP Conformity Assessment would be required.

Patent Declaration (CTD/PRISM section 1.12)
A signed and dated patent declaration form is required for each NDA. Applicants
should refer to section 3 for information on patent linkage and Appendix 1 for the
Patent Declaration Form template.

Guiding notes on filling the Patent Declaration form are provided below.

declaration form and the evidence of authorisation are current at the point of application
submission.


Declaration for NDA Verification (CTD/PRISM section 1.14)
This section applies only to the verification evaluation route.

A declaration letter issued by the product owner/applicant must be provided to state
that all aspects of the product’s quality are identical to that currently approved by
the chosen primary reference agency at the time of submission. Quality aspects
include, but are not limited to, formulation, manufacturing site(s), release and shelf
life specifications, and primary packaging. However, a different container closure
system type (e.g. Alu/Alu blister vs. HDPE bottle) may be proposed to meet ASEAN
stability requirements.

If a Drug Master File is submitted, then a separate declaration letter issued by the
applicant must also be provided to state that the DMF submitted to HSA is identical
to that submitted to the chosen primary reference agency.

Registration Status in Other Countries (CTD/PRISM section 1.15)
The registration status of the product in other countries should be entered into
PRISM section 4.9 – refer to Appendix 17 for further details.

In the event that the PRISM text space does not allow the input of the full details of

#### 15.3 Quality Documents...............................................................................

The quality documents relate to Module 3 of the ICH CTD or Part II of the ACTD.
In addition to the ICH or ACTD technical content requirements, the following
explanatory notes pertain to requirements specific to Singapore:

##### 15.3.1 Body of Data – Drug Substance

The ICH M4Q technical guideline and ASEAN Common Technical Requirements
(ACTR) provide details on the information to be included in the drug substance
sections of an application dossier.

All of the drug substance sections of the CTD – i.e. S.1 to S. 7 – should be submitted
in the application. If these sections are incomplete, then the dossier should make

```
NOTE: If a drug product contains more than one drug substance, the information within
Module 3.2.S (ICH CTD) or Part II.S (ACTD) must be provided in its entirety for each
drug substance.
```

reference to a Drug Master File (DMF), Plasma Master File (PMF) or Certificate of
Suitability of Monographs of the European Pharmacopoeia (CEP).

Because the drug product manufacturer is responsible for the quality control of the
drug substance that is used in the drug product, applicants should note that the
complete S section of the CTD dossier should be provided by the drug product
manufacturer regardless of whether a DMF or a CEP has been submitted in support
of a product application.

Drug Master File (DMF)
A Drug Master File (DMF) is a compilation of information on facilities, processes or
components used in the manufacturing, processing, packaging and storing of a
drug that is submitted to the HSA. A DMF contains confidential information and is
submitted solely at the discretion of the DMF holder.

A DMF is submitted in support of a therapeutic product application, and will be
reviewed only in connection with the review of an application. As such, a separate
approval will not be issued for a DMF.

Appendix 11 describes the DMF process and documentary requirements for DMF
submission.

Plasma Master File (PMF)
A Plasma Master File (PMF) is required whenever a human plasma-derived product
is used either as a drug substance or as an excipient, as the PMF contains
information on the collection and control of source materials. The PMF may be
submitted either as a stand-alone document or as part of the application dossier.
Appendix 8 describes the PMF data requirements for submission.

If the PMF is a stand-alone document, then it should be filed separately from the
application dossier for pre-marketing evaluation. The applicant may cross-reference
a PMF that is currently registered with HSA where applicable.


Certificates of Suitability (CEP)
A Certificate of Suitability is a document issued by the European Directorate for the
Quality of Medicines and Healthcare (EDQM) that certifies the quality of a drug
substance in compliance to the Ph. Eur. A CEP may be submitted in lieu of the CTD
S Section or a DMF.

If reference is made to a CEP, the applicant should submit a copy of the duly
authorised, valid CEP, including all annexes. A duly authorised CEP should contain
the following information in the ‘Declaration of Access’ section of the CEP:
- name of the Product Owner or local applicant;
- name of the product to be registered – it is recommended that the dosage form
and strength(s) also be stated;
- signature of the CEP holder; and
- date of authorisation.

The following additional requirements apply for CEP-based submissions:

(a) If Ph. Eur. standard is claimed for the drug substance, the relevant CTDs should
be submitted:
(i) S.2.1;
(ii) S.4.1 and S.4.4 from both the drug substance and drug product
manufacturers; and
(iii) S.6 and S.7 should be provided if the re-test period/shelf life is not stated
on the CEP.

(b) If other standards are claimed for the drug substance, the relevant CTDs
should be submitted:
(i) S.2.1;
(ii) S.4.1 to S.4.5 from both drug substance and drug product manufacturers;
and
(iii) S.6 and S.7 should be provided if re-test period/shelf life is not stated on
the CEP.

```
NOTE: HSA reserves the right to request for any additional information about the CEP-
certified drug substance if it is deemed appropriate.
```

If there is a CEP for animal-derived material used in the drug product, the applicant
may submit the CEP together with the documents stipulated in Annex 1- section 1.1
of Appendix 9 Guideline on the Registration of Human Medicinal Products
Containing Materials of Animal Origin.

It is the applicant’s responsibility to submit the latest CEP updates, with annexes,
as soon as they are available from EDQM.

Control of Drug Substance (CTD section 3.2.S.4)
Batch analysis data should be provided by the drug substance and drug product
manufacturers, and, if available, from the same drug substance batches. Analytical
results should be provided from a minimum of two batches from each proposed
drug substance manufacturer and should be sufficient to support the
specification(s) as well as to demonstrate consistency in manufacturing. The
batches submitted should preferably be of production scale or at least pilot scale.

Stability Data of Drug Substance (CTD section 3.2.S.7)
At the time of submission, the minimum stability data required are as follows:
- At least 12 months of long term data and 6 months of accelerated data from at
least three primary batches of the drug substance; and
- The batches should be at least pilot scale-sized and manufactured by a method
that simulates the final commercial process.

If the drug substance is sourced from multiple sites, stability data from each site
should be provided.

HSA may request for additional stability data if deemed necessary for the evaluation
of the application.

##### 15.3.2 Body of Data – Drug Product

The ICH M4Q technical guideline and ACTR also provide details on the information
to be included in the drug product sections of an application dossier. For drug
product intermediates and diluents, separate drug product sections should be
submitted.


Pharmaceutical Development (CTD section 3.2.P.2)
Detailed descriptions and discussions, with relevant data, which relate to the
development, and hence quality, of the drug product should be provided in the
relevant dossier sections. Examples include, but are not limited to:
- polymorphism, solubility or particle size of the drug substance and its effect on
the product’s quality;
- a description and the results of the formulation development;
- the rationale for the choice of dissolution method and a discussion of its
discriminatory nature, with data;
- compatibility of the container closure system with the product or preservative
efficacy test results; and
- optimisation of the manufacturing process, with data.

Process Validation (CTD section 3.2.P.3.5)
The description, documentation and complete results of the validation studies on
the manufacturing process should be provided in the dossier in this section.
Particular care should be taken to ensure that the documents include critical
processes for the manufacturing process: for example, blend uniformity validation
for oral dosage forms and terminal sterilisation or aseptic filling for sterile products.

Applicants should refer to the ASEAN Guidelines on Submission of Manufacturing
Process Validation Data for Drug Registration and the ASEAN Guideline on
Process Validation Q&A for the minimum data requirements for process validation.
Other relevant international guidelines may also be referred to as appropriate.

Where ranges of batch sizes are proposed, it should be demonstrated that
variations in batch size would not adversely alter the characteristics of the finished
product.

For drug product manufacturing sites that use parametric release (e.g. where a
terminally sterilised product is released based on the review of manufacturing
process data instead of sterility testing), a more detailed discussion with supporting
data on the process validation of the specific product in the proposed pack size or
fill volume should be provided. In addition, risk assessment for parametric release


should be based on prior knowledge, consistency of performance of the steriliser,
historical batch analysis data, risk of loading pattern/container/ contamination from
the environment to product sterility, re-processing plan, etc. A detailed discussion
on the control strategy should also be provided. This includes but is not limited to,
a tabulation of all validated critical process parameters and loading patterns, a
description of the process and requirements for the release/rejection of a batch,
bioburden monitoring and control program, the segregation of sterile products from
non-sterile products and the routine maintenance/re-validation program for the
steriliser.

Control of Excipients (CTD section 3.2.P.4)
This section refers to all excipients used in the drug product formulation, including
ingredients used in capsule shells and film coatings. The specifications and
analytical method(s) for each excipient should be described, including the validation
of any in-house test method(s), if applicable.

Information on proprietary ingredients, such as flavourings, colourants, coatings,
perfumes and/or printing inks, should be as detailed as possible. Applicants are
advised not to use internal codes but instead to give commercial names for such
ingredients. In cases where the formula of the proprietary ingredient is confidential,
only the total quantity of the proprietary ingredient present in the final product needs
to be captured in PRISM. The formula of the proprietary ingredient should then be
provided by the proprietary ingredient manufacturer directly to HSA. A declaration
letter from the proprietary ingredient manufacturer should also be provided,
indicating that they will inform HSA (via email to HSA_TP_Enquiry@hsa.gov.sg)
should there be any change in the qualitative formulation of the proprietary
ingredient.

A CoA for an excipient may be submitted in lieu of the excipient’s specifications. If
the standard claimed for an excipient is an officially recognised compendial
standard, it is sufficient to state that the excipient is tested according to the
requirements of that standard, rather than reproducing the specifications found in
the officially recognised compendial monograph.


For excipients derived from human plasma, applicants should refer to the Appendix
8 for more information on the data requirements.

For excipients derived from animal sources, applicants should refer to Appendix 9
for more information. The checklist found in Annex 1 of Appendix 9 serves as a
guide to these documentary requirements for submission. Applicants should note
that the completed checklist in Annex 1 is to be submitted in CTD section 3.2.P.4.5
with the supporting documents submitted in ICH CTD section 3.2.A.2 or ACTD
section Q.A.2.

For milk and certain milk derivatives such as lactose, as these excipients are
generally considered non-infectious, a declaration from the supplier of the excipient
stating that the milk is from healthy cows fit for human consumption and that no
other potentially infectious ruminant-derived materials were used in the
manufacturing process would be sufficient. This declaration is to be submitted in
CTD section 3.2.P.4.5.

Control of Drug Product (CTD section 3.2.P.5)
The drug product’s release and shelf-life specifications should be declared in
section 3.2.P.5.1.

For the parametric release of a terminally sterilised product, the release
specification and certificate of analysis should indicate that parametric release is
the method used for batch release. Additionally, sterility of the product is required
to be demonstrated in the stability studies even if approval for parametric release
has been granted.

Descriptions of all test methods with complete validation results of all in-house
methods should be submitted in sections 3.2.P.5.2 and 3.2.P.5.3.

Descriptions (including size, origin and use) and test results of all relevant batches
(e.g. pre-clinical, clinical, pilot and production batches) used to establish the
specification and evaluate the consistency in manufacturing should be provided.


Batch analysis data and/or CoAs from three batches of the drug product should be
provided in section 3.2.P.5.4.

The justification of the specifications (section 3.2.P.5.6) should be based on
scientific knowledge and data collected during product development.

Container Closure System (CTD section 3.2.P.7)
Technical information about each component of the container closure system(s)
used for the drug product should be included in the dossier. The technical
information to be included in the dossier includes, but is not limited to, schematic
diagrams, descriptions, specifications, analytical methods, CoAs and declarations
of compliance to international standards.

Stability Data of Drug Product (CTD section 3.2.P.8)
Since 0 1 April 2014, HSA has implemented the ASEAN Guideline on Stability Study
of Drug Product (the _‘ASEAN guideline’_ ), a guideline on the conduct of stability
studies for drug products for the ASEAN region. Applicants should familiarise
themselves with this guideline prior to submission.

At the time of submission of the application, the minimum stability data required are
as follows:
- At least 12 months of data under long term storage conditions and 6 months of
data under accelerated storage conditions on at least three primary batches of
the drug product, as per the ASEAN guideline; and
- The primary batches should be manufactured by the same method(s) and
packaged in the same container closure system as that proposed for Singapore.

It is recommended that the submitted stability data be specific for the sites proposed
for registration in Singapore. For example, for a proposed product, if the drug
substance is sourced from two different sites (e.g. sites A and B), the minimum
stability data requirements for this drug product should include one set (3 batches)
for the drug product with drug substance from site A and one set (3 batches) for the
drug product with drug substance from site B – i.e. a total of six batches under long
term conditions and six batches under accelerated conditions.


The table below illustrates the minimum requirement at the time of submission:

E.g. For drug substance sites A and B, drug product site Z.
Dataset submitted:
3 batches of A + Z AND 3 batches of B + Z

However, if the complete set of site-specific drug product stability data is not
available at the time of submission of the application for chemical drug products,
then the following conditions and requirements will apply:

(a) Multiple drug substance manufacturers:

```
If multiple drug substance manufacturers for one drug substance of the drug
product are proposed for registration, then the following dataset is the minimum
requirement at the time of submission:
(i) The full CTD S section or CEP from each drug substance manufacturer;
(ii) The same specification used by the drug product manufacturer for control
of the drug substance (the ‘DP-DS specification’) from all of the proposed
drug substance manufacturers, should encompass the following:
(A) The DP-DS specification captures all test parameters and limits from
all of the proposed drug substance manufacturers, unless justified;
(B) If the same test parameter exists among the different drug substance
manufacturers (e.g. assay, degradation products), then the limit should
be aligned in the DP-DS specification; and
(C) If different test parameters exists among the drug substance
manufacturers (e.g. residual solvents), then the limit should remain the
same in the DP-DS specification.
The table below illustrates common DP-DS specification:

(iii) A minimum of one set^ (3 batches) of drug product stability data that
represents all of the proposed drug substance manufacturers; and

(iv) If the submitted stability dataset in (iii) does not represent all of the
proposed drug substance manufacturers, then a commitment letter to
conduct drug product stability studies for one production-sized batch using
the drug substance from each additional drug substance manufacturer that
is not represented in (iii) is required.

The table below illustrates the possible submission options, which the applicant
can choose one from at the time of submission:

E.g. For drug substance sites A and B (chemical drug substance only), drug
product site Z.


```
Dataset submitted: With commitment letter for:^
Option 1:
3 batches of data using A+Z
1 production drug product batch for
B+Z
Option 2:

1 production drug product batch for
A+Z
Option 3:
3 batches of data using A+Z and
B+Z
```
```

```
```
Note: This approach does not apply to biological drug products – i.e. full drug
substance site-specific drug product stability data are required at the time of
submission.
```
(b) Multiple drug product manufacturers:

```
For biological drug products, the complete set of site-specific drug product
stability data is required at the time of submission of the product application. For
dossiers that are not able to meet this submission requirement, the applicant is
highly recommended to discuss the issues with HSA prior to submission in order
to facilitate the registration process.
```
```
If multiple drug product manufacturers for the drug product are proposed for
registration, then the following dataset is the minimum requirement at the time
of submission:
(i) Drug product stability batches from each proposed drug product
manufacturer should be represented;
(ii) The number of batches from each proposed drug product manufacturer
must meet the submission requirement i.e. 3 batches of drug product with:
- A minimum of 12 months of stability data from one of the drug product
manufacturer; and
```

```
- A minimum of 6 months of stability data from the other drug product
manufacturer(s).
```
If a drug product manufacturer has manufactured development or pilot drug
product batches but is not intended for registration, then the development/pilot
drug product batches may be submitted in support of the proposed shelf-life and
storage condition if the following dataset is submitted at the time of submission:
(i) The complete CTD P.3 section (process validation to be submitted, if
available) from the development/pilot drug product manufacturing site;
(ii) Batch analyses or certificates of analysis (CTD P5.4) of the stability batches
from the development/pilot manufacturing site;
(iii) Three (3) batches of a minimum of 12 months of stability data from the
development/pilot manufacturing site, as per the ASEAN guideline;
(iv) Three (3 batches) of a minimum of 6 months of stability data from the
proposed drug product manufacturing site; and
(v) A commitment to provide the completed stability studies (up to the proposed
shelf-life) from the proposed drug product manufacturing site.

The table below illustrates the possible submission options, which the applicant
can choose one from at the time of submission:

E.g. For drug substance site A, drug product sites Y and Z.
Dataset submitted:
Option 1:
3 batches of a minimum 12 months stability data from one of the proposed
commercial DP site (A+Y)
AND
3 batches of a minimum 6 months stability data from the other proposed
commercial DP site (A+Z)
Option 2:
3 batches of a minimum 12 months stability data from developmental/pilot
DP site (A+Y)
AND


```
3 batches of a minimum 6 months stability data from proposed
commercial DP site (A+Z)
```
(c) Multiple drug substance and drug product manufacturers:

```
If multiple drug substance and drug product manufacturers are proposed for
registration, then the dataset required at the time of submission will combine the
requirements in (a) and (b) above.
```

* Not all drug substance sites are represented; thus, a commitment to conduct
stability on one production drug product batch (from either site Y or Z) using drug
substance site B is required at the time of submission.

(d) Multiple primary packagers:

```
If multiple primary packaging sites for the same container closure system are
proposed for registration, then the following dataset is the minimum requirement
at the time of submission:
(i) A minimum of one set (3 batches) of 12 months of stability data from one
of the primary packaging sites;
(ii) Transport validation of the bulk product to the other proposed primary
packaging site(s), unless justification is provided; and
(iii) A minimum of one set (3 batches) of 6 months of stability data from the
other primary packaging site(s) with a commitment to provide the data upon
completion of the stability study.
```
(e) Drug product stability batch(es) using development or pilot drug substance
batches:

```
If the submitted stability dataset (3 batches) uses development or pilot drug
substance batches, the stability dataset may be submitted in support of the
proposed shelf-life and storage condition if the following dataset is submitted at
the time of submission:
(i) CTD S section (S2.2, S3.1, S3.2, S4.1 and S4.4) from the development/pilot
drug product manufacturing site;
(ii) One set (3 batches) of a minimum of 12 months of stability data using drug
substance manufactured from developmental or pilot drug substance site;
(iii) A commitment letter to conduct one set (3 batches) of long term and
accelerated stability studies using drug substance manufactured from the
```

```
proposed drug substance site(s), and report if any results fall outside shelf-
life specifications (with proposed action) or when requested; and
(iv) Prior to approval: To provide a minimum of 6 months of stability data as
committed in (iii).
```
#### 15.4 Non-clinical Documents

The non-clinical documents relate to Module 4 of the ICH CTD or Part III of the
ACTD.

Applicants should refer to the ICH CTD Guidelines M4S (Safety) technical
guidelines or the ACTD Part III: Nonclinical guidelines for detailed information on
the contents of non-clinical documents for the application dossier.

#### 15.5 Clinical Documents

The clinical documents relate to Module 5 of the ICH CTD or Part IV of the ACTD.

Guidance on how to complete this Module/Part is provided in the ICH CTD
Guideline M4E (Efficacy) technical guidelines, in particular the ICH E3 guidance
document on Structure and Contents of Clinical Study Reports, or the ACTD Part
IV: Clinical guidelines.

Clinical studies should generally be conducted using the drug product formulation
submitted in the application and in the appropriate patient population for the
indication(s) and/or dosing regimen(s) as requested in the NDA.

Biopharmaceutic (e.g. bioavailability or bioequivalence) study reports are required
if the commercial formulation for the Singapore market differs from the clinical trial
formulation used in the pivotal studies.

The submission of risk management plans (RMPs) in support of all NDA- 1
applications is mandatory. For NDA-2 or NDA-3 applications, HSA may also request
for RMPs to be submitted on a case-by-case basis when required, following the
evaluation of the safety concerns described in the product application. Guidance on


RMP submission requirements can be found in Appendix 16 Guideline on the
Submission of Risk Management Plan Documents.

If the NDA is for a non-prescription medicine and is submitted via the abridged
evaluation route, the applicant may submit a written request for a waiver of clinical
data submission. Eligibility for a waiver is subject to the criteria defined in Appendix
6 Guideline on Submission for Non-Prescription Therapeutic Products. However,
HSA reserves the right to request for the complete clinical data set if it is deemed
necessary.

#### 15.6 Specific Documentary Requirements for Each Evaluation Route

proposed PI/PIL should be identical to that approved by this reference drug
regulatory agency (with the exception of country-specific information).


## Chapter D - Generic Drug Application Submission

This chapter applies to applications to register generic products.

A generic drug application applies to a therapeutic product that contains one or
more chemical entities, and that is essentially the same with a current registered
product with respect to its qualitative and quantitative composition of active
ingredients, pharmaceutical dosage form and clinical indication.

Follow-on biologic products (also known as biosimilar products) are not eligible for
a GDA and are required to be submitted via a NDA.

### 16 APPLICATION TYPES

There are two application types for a generic drug application:

```
GDA Generic Drug Application
```
###### GDA-1:

```
For the first strength of a generic chemical product.
```
###### GDA-2:

```
For subsequent strength(s) of the generic chemical product that has been
registered or submitted as GDA-1. The product name and dosage form
should be the same as that for the GDA-1.
```
In cases where multiple strengths of a generic product are submitted together, the
strength of the product used in the BE study is considered as a GDA-1. The
remaining strength(s) should be submitted as GDA-2.

#### 16.1 Generic Product

A generic product must have the same qualitative and quantitative composition in
active substances and be of the same pharmaceutical form as a currently registered
product in Singapore (known as the ‘Singapore reference product’). A generic
product must demonstrate bioequivalence to the Singapore reference product via
appropriate bioequivalence studies.


The generic product must fulfil the following criteria:
(a) the generic product is the same pharmaceutical dosage form as the Singapore
reference product. However, different conventional oral immediate-release
dosage forms (i.e. tablets and capsules) are considered to be the same
pharmaceutical form;

(b) the route of administration of the generic product is the same as the Singapore
reference product;

(c) the conditions of use for the generic product fall within the directions for use
(including indication(s), dosing regimen(s) and patient group(s)) for the
Singapore reference product; and

(d) the generic product is bioequivalent with the Singapore reference product.

#### 16.2 Singapore Reference Product

The Singapore reference product must be a currently registered product that has
been granted market authorisation based on the evaluation of the product’s quality,
efficacy and safety – i.e. a dossier with chemical, biological, pharmaceutical,
pharmacological-toxicological and clinical data. If such a reference product is not
registered in Singapore, then an alternate registered comparator product may be
used if adequately justified (e.g. a registered generic therapeutic product widely
used by local hospitals) by the applicant and agreed upon by HSA.

The generic product should contain the same active substance(s) and strength(s)
and be the same pharmaceutical dosage form as the Singapore reference product.

For generic products containing a different salt, ester, ether, isomer, mixture of
isomer, complex or derivative of the active substance compared to the Singapore
reference product, applicants are required to submit data to demonstrate that the
different form does not differ from the active substance in the Singapore reference
product in terms of safety and/or efficacy.

Applicants are advised to search HSA’s Register of Therapeutic Products to identify
the Singapore reference product. Applicants are encouraged to contact HSA to


discuss the acceptability of a GDA if the generic product does not have a registered
Singapore reference product of the same strength. In these instances, applicants
should provide scientific justifications for HSA’s consideration.

Applicants submitting GDAs should also refer to Appendix 10 for further details on
product interchangeability and biowaiver requests.

### 17 EVALUATION ROUTES

There are three evaluation routes for a GDA: abridged, verification and verification-
CECA evaluation routes. The eligibility criteria are different for each evaluation
route. Applicants should be familiar with the criteria for each evaluation route
because each route has different documentary requirements.

Figure 4 is a schematic diagram illustrating the evaluation routes for GDAs:

#### 17.1 Abridged Evaluation Route

Abridged evaluation applies to a product that has been approved by at least one
drug regulatory agency at the time of submission.

#### 17.2 Verification Evaluation Route

The verification evaluation route applies to a product that has been evaluated and
approved by at least one of the following HSA’s reference drug regulatory agencies:

```

- Australia Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA);
- Health Canada;
- US Food and Drug Administration (FDA);
- European Medicines Agency (EMA) via the Centralised Procedure; and
- UK Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (UK MHRA) via

- the national procedure; or
- as the Reference Member State (RMS) via the Mutual Recognition
    Procedure or Decentralised Procedure.

However, approval by these reference drug regulatory agencies does not oblige
HSA to approve the application.

Additional eligibility criteria for the verification route include:
(a) The application must be submitted to HSA within two years from the date of
approval by the chosen reference drug regulatory agency;

(b) A declaration letter issued by the product owner/applicant must be provided
stating that all aspects of the product’s quality, including but not limited to the
formulation, manufacturing site(s), release and shelf life specifications and
primary packaging, are identical to that currently approved by the chosen
reference drug regulatory agency at the time of submission. However, a different
container closure system type (e.g. Alu/Alu blister vs. HDPE bottle) may be
proposed to meet ASEAN stability requirements;

(c) If a Drug Master File is submitted, then a separate declaration letter issued by
the applicant must also be provided to state that the DMF submitted to HSA is
identical to that submitted to the chosen reference drug regulatory agency;

(d) The product and its intended use – i.e. indication(s), dosing regimen(s) and
patient group(s) – have not been rejected, withdrawn, or approved via appeal
process or are not pending deferral by a drug regulatory agency for efficacy
and/or safety reasons; and,

(e) The product has not been approved by the chosen reference drug regulatory
agency via an accelerated/fast-track approval, approval under exceptional
circumstances or an equivalent process.


```
The chosen reference drug regulatory agency is defined as the reference drug
regulatory agency for which the qualifying supporting documents (as outlined in this
guidance) will be submitted.

#### 18.1 Administrative Documents

The administrative documents relate to Module 1 of the ICH CTD or Part I of the
ACTD and are applicable to the evaluation routes for GDAs. The following sections
are to be submitted:

Cover Letter (to attach under CTD/PRISM section 1.2 - Introduction)
To include a cover letter stating the product name, and the number of CD/DVDs
submitted in the application dossier.

Comprehensive Table of Contents (CTD/PRISM section 1. 1 )
The comprehensive table of contents is a complete list of all documents provided
in the application dossier listed by Module/Part. The location of each document
should be identified by the Module/Part number.

Introduction (CTD/PRISM section 1. 2 )
Applicants should give a concise summary of the application – for example, an
overview of the bioequivalence study and the Singapore reference product used in
support of the application.

Applicants should also justify the lack of certain documents within the dossier and
deviation from the guidelines, if any.

Labelling, Package Insert and Patient Information Leaflet (CTD/PRISM section 1.4)
All proposed labels are to be submitted for registration. Applicants are required to
provide the artwork/drafts of the proposed Singapore product labels, PI and/or PIL
for the product. The clinical information in the proposed PI/PIL should be consistent
with that currently approved for the Singapore reference product.

```
NOTE: Applicants must complete the relevant checklists found in Appendix 2A or
Appendix 3A and attach the completed checklist under PRISM section 1.2
```

The submission of the proposed PI or PIL is dependent on the forensic classification
of the product to be registered, as described in Table 8 :

warranted
Required Required
One PI and/or PIL should be registered for each product application. If multiple
manufacturing sites are proposed for registration, information for all sites should be
included in one PI and/or PIL. If there are different strengths or dosage forms, one
common PI/PIL for all strengths or dosage forms is encouraged. If separate PI/PILs
are to be registered for different strengths or dosage forms, the content should be
consistent across the PI/PILs, except for strength/dosage form-specific information.
All artwork and drafts should be legible. The draft artwork of the outer carton and
inner/blister labels should be consistent with the format, design and colour that are
to be printed. Separate labels must be submitted for each different pack size of the
drug product.
Handwritten information is not acceptable, with the exception of statements such
as ‘batch number and expiry dates will be printed’ or similar on the outer carton or
inner/blister labels. Movable text boxes/pictures placed over other hidden
information/text are also not acceptable.


The product labels, PI and/or PIL must be in English. If non-English text is included
in the labelling, applicants must provide an official statement to declare that the non-
English text is complete, accurate and unbiased information and is consistent with
the English text.

Appendix 7 of this guidance contains specific details on the product labelling
requirements for Singapore.

Approved SPC/PI/PIL (CTD/PRISM section 1.5)
In this section, the applicant should submit the approved SPC, PI and/or PIL from
the drug regulatory agency that issued the proof of approval.

For applications submitted under the verification and verification-CECA evaluation
routes, the SPC/PI/PIL approved by the chosen reference drug regulatory agency
should be submitted.

The country from which the submitted SPC, PI and/or PIL originates should be
appropriately indicated (e.g. in the document file name).

Assessment Report from Reference Agencies (CTD/PRISM section 1.6)
This section refers only to applications submitted under the verification or
verification-CECA evaluation routes. Assessment reports and supporting
documents issued by the chosen reference drug regulatory agency and inserted
into this section must be unredacted and unedited. Applicants should refer to
section 18 .5.2 Verification and Verification-CECA Evaluation Routes for specific
details on the required documents.

Description of Batch Numbering System (CTD/PRISM section 1.7)
Detailed information on the system of assigning unique codes to different
production batches of the product should be provided to allow for batch
identification. Where applicable, examples of the batch numbering system should
be included to illustrate how the batch number enables identification.


Proof of Approval (CTD/PRISM sections 1.8, 1.9)
Proof of approval is not required for GDAs undergoing abridged evaluation for
finished products manufactured (up to primary packaging) in Singapore.

For an abridged evaluation of an imported GDA, proof of approval from any drug
regulatory agency is required. Proof of approval must come in the form of:
- an official approval letter, or equivalent document (e.g. Certificate of
Pharmaceutical Product), which certifies the registration status of the drug
product; and
- the SPC, PI and/or PIL approved by the drug regulatory agency that issued the
approval letter.

For a verification or verification-CECA evaluation of a GDA, proof of approval from
the chosen reference drug regulatory agency is required. Proof of approval must
come in the form of:
- an official approval letter; and
- the SPC, PI and/or PIL approved by the drug regulatory agency that issued the
approval letter.

If the SPC is in a non-English language, applicants should refer to section 6.2.2
Language and Translation of this guidance document for more information on
acceptable translations.

Note that all aspects of the product’s quality should be the same as those approved
by the drug regulatory agency that issued the approval letter.

Certificate of Pharmaceutical Product (CPP) should be valid at the time of
submission and should comply with WHO format (refer to Model certificate of a
pharmaceutical product) It is not required for information such as the product
formula, manufacturing sites, etc. to be reflected on the CPP, but if such information
are present in the CPP, the information should be consistent with that proposed for
the Singapore market. Note that CPPs that indicate that the product is not licensed
in the exporting country (including scenario where the product is licensed for “solely
for export only”) are not acceptable proof of approval.


Approval letters should either be an original copy or a certified true copy and in
English. Applicants should refer to sections 6.2.2 Language and Translation and
6.2.3 Certifying Non-Original Documents for more details. Reference to drug
regulatory authority websites in the form of website screenshot and URL (for the
website) for confirmation of the approval status of the products in that regulatory
authority are acceptable, provided that the product’s identity and product’s
ownership can be confirmed from that website.

HSA reserves the right to request for a Certificate of Pharmaceutical Product (CPP),
if deemed appropriate.

If the brand name (trade name) of the product registered in the country which issued
the proof of approval is different from that proposed in Singapore, the applicant is
required to submit a declaration letter from the product owner to declare that both
products marketed under the different brand names are identical in all aspects of
quality, safety and efficacy except for the brand name.

Authorisation Letters (CTD/PRISM section 1.10)
All submitted authorisation letter(s) should be on the authorising company’s (i.e.
product owner’s) letterhead, dated and signed by the designated authorised person
in the company.

If the product owner is not the local applicant, manufacturer and/or batch releaser;
or the product owner’s address is different from that of the local applicant firm,
manufacturer and/or batch releaser, then the following authorisation letter(s) must
be submitted:

(a) from Product Owner to the Applicant (Company) (1.10.1) – this letter authorises
the local applicant to apply for and be the product registrant for a specific
therapeutic product (product name to be stated as in PRISM) and be responsible
for all matters pertaining to the registration of this product in Singapore.

(b) from Product Owner to Manufacturer (1.10.2) – this letter authorises the
specified manufacturer to produce, pack and/or label the drug product intended
for Singapore. If there are multiple drug product manufacturers, then the


```
applicant may opt to submit one authorisation letter which clearly states all of
the manufacturers (names and addresses) and their responsibilities relating to
the drug product (such as the manufacturing operation of each manufacturer in
relation to the product being submitted).
```
(c) from Product Owner to Batch Releaser (1.10.3) – this letter authorises the
specified company to batch release the drug product. If there are multiple sites
responsible for the batch release of the product, then the applicant may opt to
submit one authorisation letter which clearly states all of the batch releasers
(names and addresses) and their responsibilities.

The applicant may also issue an authorisation letter to authorise the specified
secondary packager located in Singapore to pack and/or label the drug product
intended for Singapore.

Applicants are to ensure that all names and addresses in the authorisation letter(s)
are consistent with the information provided in PRISM and the dossier. For
manufacturers and batch releasers, the actual site address of the named company
should be stated in the letter(s) – i.e. do not state the office address. Any
discrepancy found will delay the registration process.

All authorisation letters should also state specific product details, including the
product name, dosage form and strength as stated in the PRISM application form.

Applicants also have the option to combine the authorisation letters as stated above
into one document, provided that all names, addresses and responsibilities are
clearly stated.

GMP Certification/Proof of GMP Compliance (CTD/PRISM section 1.11)
Documentary evidence must be provided to certify that the manufacturer(s)
complies with current applicable GMP standards. Applicants must submit a GMP
certificate issued by a drug regulatory agency for all drug product manufacturing
sites including, but not limited to, bulk product manufacturer(s), primary packer(s)
and secondary packer(s). A CPP may be submitted in lieu of a GMP certificate
provided that the manufacturer’s name(s) and address(es) is(are) stated on the


CPP and the CPP states that the certifying authority conducts periodic inspection
of the manufacturing plant in which the dosage form is produced. Applicants should
note that the names and addresses of all manufacturers should be consistent
throughout the application – i.e. GMP certificate, Letter of Authorisation, CTD
section S.2.1 and P.3.1 and PRISM.

EudraGMP, the database of the European Community of manufacturing
authorisations and of certificates of good manufacturing practice, is an acceptable
alternative proof of GMP compliance in lieu of a GMP certification. Applicants
making reference to the EudraGMP as the proof of GMP compliance should provide
a screen capture of the EudraGMP website for the specific finished product
manufacturing site, as well as the URL to the website.

Certain accreditation documents/certificates issued by other drug regulatory
agencies (for example, Japan/PMDA Accreditation Certificate of Foreign Drug
Manufacturer, US/FDA Establishment Licence, Canada/Health Canada
Establishment Licence) are not acceptable proof of GMP compliance.

Proof of GMP compliance must be valid at the time of submission to HSA and must
be in English. Applicants should refer to section 6.2.2 Language and Translation.

If the submitted proof of GMP compliance is no longer valid or has less than 1
month’s validity at the time of acceptance of the application for evaluation, HSA
reserves the right to request for a commitment letter from the applicant to submit an
updated and valid proof of GMP compliance by a specified date post-acceptance.

It should be noted that diluents used for reconstituting the drug product and are
packaged together with the drug product will be considered as part of the final drug
product. Thus, manufacturer(s) of the supplied diluent(s) must follow the same
requirements applicable to the drug product, e.g. provide proof of GMP compliance.

```
NOTE: For applications submitted via the verification-CECA evaluation route, a valid
GMP certificate and the latest inspection report as issued by the chosen reference drug
regulatory agency must be submitted.
```

For products manufactured in the USA or Canada, if the applicant is unable to
obtain any proof of GMP compliance (in the form of a CPP or GMP certificate) from
either US FDA/Health Canada or other drug regulatory agencies, the applicant is
required to submit the latest Establishment Inspection Report (EIR) issued by US
FDA or Inspection Exit Notice issued by Health Canada, and any other relevant
supporting documents^11 as proof of GMP compliance. The applicant is also required
to provide the following information if not found in the inspection reports:

- the last audited date by US FDA/Health Canada;
- the approved dosage forms ;
- any licensing conditions/restriction;
- the scope of inspection; and/or
- objective evidence and the date of a satisfactory close-out of the latest
inspection conducted by US FDA/Health Canada.

For products manufactured in Switzerland, if the applicant is unable to obtain any
proof of GMP compliance (in the form of a CPP or GMP certificate) from either
SwissMedic or other drug regulatory agencies, the Manufacturer’s Licence issued
by SwissMedic is an acceptable documentary GMP evidence.

If the drug product is manufactured by a new overseas drug product
manufacturing site not previously registered with HSA before 1st April 2004,
a GMP Conformity Assessment will be conducted by HSA. Thus, when applicable,
applicants must also submit the application form to request for GMP Evidence
Evaluation or for an Overseas GMP Audit with the required documents to the
Therapeutic Products Branch (as part of the product registration application) as
stipulated in the Guidance Notes on GMP Conformity Assessment of an Overseas
Manufacturer.

In general, a GMP Conformity Assessment is applicable to each specific
manufacturer, dosage form, manufacturing activities and applicant company. This

(^11)
signed by an official of the US FDA.^ Any other supporting document which declares GMP compliance of the manufacturing site in the US and


also includes contract manufacturers who perform certain manufacturing activities,
such as terminal sterilisation of the drug product, mixing of excipient with drug
substance (drug product intermediate), etc.

In general, applicant companies with active product registration that included the
finished product manufacturer(s) performing the same manufacturing activities
(excluding parametric release) for the same dosage form would not be required to
undergo another GMP Conformity Assessment by HSA when they submit a new
product application which included the same finished product manufacturer(s).

For drug product manufacturing sites that use parametric release (e.g. where a
terminally sterilised product is released based on the review of manufacturing
process data instead of sterility testing), a GMP Conformity Assessment is required
for overseas drug product manufacturers. Eligibility criteria for such applications for
overseas manufacturing sites are:
a) Country of origin must be a PIC/S country
b) Parametric release is approved by the local authority

If the above criteria are met, then approval letter and recent documentary evidence
of approval status (e.g. GMP Certificate) for parametric release issued by the local
authority should be provided. The manufacturing site and the product proposed for
parametric release should be clearly stated on these documents.

For local manufacturing site that would like to apply for parametric release,
applicants are advised to contact HSA prior to submission as pre-approval
inspection is required.

HSA reserves the right to request for a GMP Conformity Assessment if deemed
necessary, or to request for additional or updated documents as evidence of GMP
compliance during the course of the registration process. HSA also reserves the
right to conduct an audit of any overseas manufacturer irrespective of the
documentary GMP evidence that is approved by HSA or any other PIC/S member
authorities, if deemed appropriate.


If in doubt whether a GMP Conformity Assessment by HSA is required for the
manufacturing sites included in the submission, applicants are encouraged to
complete and submit applications to request for GMP Conformity Assessment with
the product registration application, and HSA will advise accordingly whether the
GMP Conformity Assessment would be required.

Patent Declaration (CTD/PRISM 1.12)
A signed and dated patent declaration form is required for each GDA. Applicants
should refer to section 3 for information on patent linkage and Appendix 1 for the

This section applies only to the verification and verification-CECA evaluation routes.

A declaration letter issued by the product owner/applicant must be provided to state
that all aspects of the product’s quality are identical to that currently approved by
the chosen reference drug regulatory agency at the time of submission. Quality
aspects include, but are not limited to, formulation, manufacturing site(s), release
and shelf life specifications, and primary packaging.

If a Drug Master File is submitted, then a separate declaration letter issued by the
applicant must also be provided to state that the DMF submitted to HSA is identical
to that submitted to the chosen reference drug regulatory agency.

Registration Status in Other Countries (CTD/PRISM section 1.15)
The registration status of the product in other countries should be entered into
PRISM section 4.9 – refer to Appendix 17 of this document for further details.

In the event that the PRISM text space does not allow the input of the full details of
the indication(s) and/or reason(s), a brief description may be entered. The full

#### 18.2 CTD Overview and Summaries

The ICH or ASEAN Quality Overall Summary is to be inserted into Module 2 of the
ICH CTD or into Part II, section B of the ACTD. This document can be submitted
either in Word or PDF format.

#### 18.3 Quality Documents.............................................................................

The quality documents relate to Module 3 of the ICH CTD or Part II of the ACTD. In
addition to the ICH or ACTD technical content requirements, the following
explanatory notes pertain to requirements specific to Singapore:

##### 18.3.1 Body of Data – Drug Substance

The ICH M4Q technical guideline and ASEAN Common Technical Requirements
(ACTR) provide details on the information to be included in the drug substance
sections of an application dossier.

All of the drug substance sections of the CTD – i.e. S1 to S7 – should be submitted
in the application. If these sections are incomplete, then the dossier should make
reference to a Drug Master File (DMF) or Certificate of Suitability of Monographs of
the European Pharmacopoeia (CEP).

Because the drug product manufacturer is responsible for the quality control of the
drug substance that is used in the drug product, applicants should note that the
complete S section of the CTD dossier should be provided by the drug product
manufacturer regardless of whether a DMF or a CEP has been submitted in support
of a product application.

Drug Master File (DMF)
A Drug Master File (DMF) is a compilation of information on facilities, processes or
components used in the manufacturing, processing, packaging and storing of a

```
NOTE: If a drug product contains more than one drug substance, the information within
Module 3.2.S (ICH CTD) or Part 2.S (ACTD) must be provided in its entirety for each
drug substance.
```

drug that is submitted to the HSA. A DMF contains confidential information and is
submitted solely at the discretion of the DMF holder.

A DMF is submitted in support of a therapeutic product application, and will be
reviewed only in connection with the review of an application. As such, a separate
approval will not be issued for a DMF.

Appendix 11 describes the DMF process and documentary requirements for DMF
submission.

Certificates of Suitability (CEP)
A Certificate of Suitability is a document issued by the European Directorate for the
Quality of Medicines and Healthcare (EDQM) that certifies the quality of a drug
substance in compliance to the Ph. Eur. A CEP may be submitted in lieu of the CTD
S Section or a DMF.

If reference is made to a CEP, the applicant should submit a copy of the duly
authorised, valid CEP, including all annexes. A duly authorised CEP should contain
the following information in the ‘Declaration of Access’ section of the CEP:
- name of the Product Owner or local applicant;
- name of the product to be registered – it is recommended that the dosage form
and strength(s) also be stated;
- signature of the CEP holder; and
- date of authorisation.

The following additional requirements apply for CEP-based submissions:

(a) If Ph. Eur. standard is claimed for the drug substance, the relevant CTDs should
be submitted:
(i) S.2.1;
(ii) S.4.1 and S.4.4 from both the drug substance and drug product
manufacturers; and
(iii) S.6 and S.7 should be provided if the re-test period/shelf life is not stated
on the CEP.


(b) If other standards are claimed for the drug substance, the relevant CTDs should
be submitted:
(i) S.2.1;
(ii) S.4.1 to S.4.5 from both drug substance and drug product manufacturers;
and
(iii) S.6 and S.7 should be provided if re-test period/shelf life is not stated on
the CEP.

If there is a CEP for animal-derived material used in the drug product, the applicant
may submit the CEP together with the documents stipulated in Annex 1- section 1.1
of Appendix 9 Guideline on the Registration of Human Medicinal Products
Containing Materials of Animal Origin.

It is the applicant’s responsibility to submit the latest CEP updates, with annexes,
as soon as they are available from EDQM.

Control of Drug Substance (CTD section 3.2.S.4)
Batch analysis data should be provided by the drug substance and drug product
manufacturers, and if available, from the same drug substance batches. Analytical
results should be provided from a minimum of two batches from each proposed
drug substance manufacturer and should be sufficient to support the
specification(s) as well as to demonstrate consistency in manufacturing. The
batches submitted should preferably be of production scale or at least pilot scale
and should include the batch(es) used in the bioequivalence or biowaiver studies
(where applicable).

Stability Data of Drug Substance (CTD section 3.2.S.7)
At the time of submission, the minimum stability data required are as follows:
- At least 12 months of long term data and 6 months of accelerated data from at
least three primary batches of the drug substance;

```
NOTE: HSA reserves the right to request for any additional information about the CEP-
certified drug substance if it is deemed appropriate.
```

- The batches should be at least pilot scale-sized and manufactured by a method
that simulates the final commercial process.

If the drug substance is sourced from multiple sites, stability data from each site
should be provided.

HSA may request for additional stability data if deemed necessary for the evaluation
of the application.

##### 18.3.2 Body of Data – Drug Product

The ICH M4Q technical guideline and ACTR also provide details on the information
to be included in the drug product sections of an application dossier. For drug
product intermediates and diluents, separate drug product sections should be
submitted.

Pharmaceutical Development (CTD section 3.2.P.2)
Detailed descriptions and discussions, with relevant data, which relate to the
development, and hence quality, of the drug product should be provided in the
relevant dossier sections. Examples include, but are not limited to:
- polymorphism, solubility or particle size of the drug substance and its effect on
the product’s quality;
- a description and the results of the formulation development;
- the rationale for the choice of dissolution method and a discussion of its
discriminatory nature, with data;
- compatibility of the container closure system with the product or preservative
efficacy test results; and
- optimisation of the manufacturing process, with data.

Process Validation (CTD section 3.2.P.3.5)
The description, documentation and complete results of the validation studies on
the manufacturing process should be provided in the dossier in this section.
Particular care should be taken to ensure that the documents include critical
processes for the manufacturing process: for example, blend uniformity validation
for oral dosage forms and terminal sterilisation or aseptic filling for sterile products.


Applicants should refer to the ASEAN Guidelines on Submission of Manufacturing
Process Validation Data for Drug Registration and the ASEAN Guideline on
Process Validation Q&A for the minimum data requirements for process validation.
Other relevant international guidelines may also be referred to as appropriate.

Where ranges of batch sizes are proposed, it should be demonstrated that
variations in batch size would not adversely alter the characteristics of the finished
product.

For drug product manufacturing sites that use parametric release (e.g. where a
terminally sterilised product is released based on the review of manufacturing
process data instead of sterility testing), a more detailed discussion with supporting
data on the process validation of the specific product in the proposed pack size or
fill volume should be provided. In addition, risk assessment for parametric release
should be based on prior knowledge, consistency of performance of the steriliser,
historical batch analysis data, risk of loading pattern/ container/ contamination from
the environment to product sterility, re-processing plan and etc. A detailed
discussion on the control strategy should also be provided. This includes but is not
limited to, a tabulation of all validated critical process parameters and loading
patterns, a description of the process and requirements for the release/rejection of
a batch, bioburden monitoring and control program, the segregation of sterile
products from non-sterile products and the routine maintenance/re-validation
program for the steriliser.

Control of Excipients (CTD section 3.2.P.4)
This section refers to all excipients used in the drug product formulation, including
ingredients used in capsule shells and film coatings. The specifications and
analytical method(s) for each excipient should be described, including the validation
of any in-house test method(s) if applicable.

Information on proprietary ingredients such as flavourings, colourants, coatings,
perfumes and/or printing inks should be as detailed as possible. Applicants are
advised not to use internal codes but instead to give commercial names for such
ingredients. In cases where the formula of the proprietary ingredient is confidential,


only the total quantity of the proprietary ingredient present in the final product needs
to be captured in PRISM. The formula of the proprietary ingredient should then be
provided by the proprietary ingredient manufacturer directly to HSA. A declaration
letter from the proprietary ingredient manufacturer should also be provided,
indicating that they will inform HSA (via email to HSA_TP_Enquiry@hsa.gov.sg)
should there be any change in the qualitative formulation of the proprietary
ingredient.

A CoA for an excipient may be submitted in lieu of the excipient’s specifications. If
the standard claimed for an excipient is an officially recognised compendial
standard, it is sufficient to state that the excipient is tested according to the
requirements of that standard, rather than reproducing the specifications found in
the officially recognised compendial monograph.

For excipients derived from animal sources, applicants should refer to Appendix 9
for more information. The checklist found in Annex 1 of Appendix 9 serves as a
guide to these documentary requirements for submission. Applicants should note
that the completed checklist in Annex 1 is to be submitted in CTD section 3.2.P.4.5
with the supporting documents submitted in ICH CTD section 3.2.A.2 or ACTD
section Q.A.2.

For milk and certain milk derivatives such as lactose, as these excipients are
generally considered non-infectious, a declaration from the supplier of the excipient
stating that the milk is from healthy cows fit for human consumption and that no
other potentially infectious ruminant-derived materials were used in the
manufacturing process would be sufficient. This declaration is to be submitted in
CTD section 3.2.P.4.5.

Control of Drug Product (CTD section 3.2.P.5)
The drug product’s release and shelf-life specifications should be declared in
section 3.2.P.5.1.

For the parametric release of a terminally sterilised product, the release
specification and certificate of analysis should indicate that parametric release is


the method used for batch release. Additionally, sterility of the product is required
to be demonstrated in the stability studies even if approval for parametric release
has been granted.

Descriptions of all test methods with complete validation results of all in-house
methods should be included in sections 3.2.P.5.2 and 3.2.P.5.3.

Descriptions (including size, origin and use) and test results of all relevant batches
(e.g. pre-clinical, clinical, pilot and production batches) used to establish the
specification and evaluate the consistency in manufacturing should be provided.

Batch analysis data and/or CoAs from three batches of the drug product should be
provided in section 3.2.P.5.4.

The justification of the specifications (section 3.2.P.5.6) should be based on
scientific knowledge and data collected during product development.

Container Closure System (CTD section 3.2.P.7)
Technical information about each component of the container closure system(s)
used for the drug product should be included in the dossier. The technical
information to be included in the dossier includes, but is not limited to, schematic
diagrams, descriptions, specifications, analytical methods, CoAs and declarations
of compliance to international standards.

Stability Data of Drug Product (CTD section 3.2.P.8)
Since 0 1 April 2014, HSA has implemented the ASEAN Guideline on Stability Study
of Drug Product (the _‘ASEAN guideline’_ ), a guideline on the conduct of stability
studies for drug products for the ASEAN region. Applicants should familiarise
themselves with this guideline prior to submission.

At the time of submission of the application, the minimum stability data required are
as follows:
- For conventional dosage forms and stable drug substances, at least 6
months of data under long term storage conditions and 6 months of data under


```
accelerated storage conditions on at least two primary batches of the drug
product, as per the ASEAN guideline;
```
- For critical dosage forms or unstable drug substances, at least 12 months
of data under long term storage conditions and 6 months of data under
accelerated storage conditions on at least three primary batches of the drug
product, as per the ASEAN guideline; and

- The primary batches should be manufactured by the same method(s) and
packaged in the same container closure system as that proposed for Singapore.

It is recommended that the submitted stability data be specific for the sites proposed
for registration in Singapore. For example, for a proposed product, if the drug
substance is sourced from two different sites (e.g. sites A and B), the minimum
stability data requirements for this drug product should include one set^13 for the drug
product with drug substance from site A and one set^13 for the drug product with drug
substance from site B – i.e. a total of six batches under long term conditions and
six batches under accelerated conditions.

The table below illustrates the minimum requirement at the time of submission:

E.g. For drug substance sites A and B, drug product site Z.
Dataset submitted:
Conventional dosage forms and stable drug substances:
2 batches of A + Z AND 2 batches of B + Z
Critical dosage forms or unstable drug substances:
3 batches of A + Z AND 3 batches of B + Z

However, if the complete set of site-specific drug product stability data is not
available at the time of submission of the application for chemical drug products,
then the following conditions and requirements will apply:

(a) Multiple drug substance manufacturers:

(^13) ‘One set’ of stability data refers to the minimum number of batches required at the time of submission


If multiple drug substance manufacturers for one drug substance of the drug
product are proposed for registration, then the following dataset is the minimum
requirement at the time of submission:
(i) The full CTD S section or CEP from each drug substance manufacturer;

(ii) The same specification used by the drug product manufacturer for control
of the drug substance (the ‘DP-DS specification’) from all of the proposed
drug substance manufacturers, should encompass the following:
(A) The DP-DS specification captures all test parameters and limits from
all of the proposed drug substance manufacturers, unless justified;
(B) If the same test parameters exist among the different drug substance
manufacturers (e.g. assay, degradation products), then the limit should
be aligned in the DP-DS specification; and
(C) If different test parameters exist among the drug substance
manufacturers (e.g. residual solvents), then the limit should remain the
same in the DP-DS specification.

Since 0 1 April 2004, in vivo bioequivalence (BE) data are required for Prescription
Only Medicines (POM) in oral solid dosage forms.

GDA-2 applications will also require BE data if the application is for a POM in an
oral solid dosage form, even if the first strength (GDA-1) application was submitted
to HSA before 0 1 April 2004.

Applicants should be familiar with Appendix 10 Product Interchangeability and
Biowaiver Request for Chemical Generic Drug Applications.


Applicants should ensure that the submitted BE study is complete, including all
appendices and data, according to the relevant guidelines. Examples of information
to be included in the report are:
(a) Signature of the Principal Investigator to attest the authenticity of the report;
(b) Audit certificate(s);
(c) BE site inspection report from a national regulatory agency or WHO, if available;
(d) Approval letter(s) from the Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics
Committee and the appropriate drug regulatory agency;
(e) Information about the reference and test products, such as the product name,
strength, dosage form, batch number, manufacturing site, batch size of the test
product, etc.;
(f) Certificates of Analysis of the reference and test products used in the BE study,
including the batch size of the test product and manufacturing/expiry date of
both products (where applicable);
(g) Bioanalytical study report and description of the bioanalytical method validation;
and
(h) A signed statement confirming that the test product used in the BE study is the
same formulation and is manufactured by the same process as that submitted
for registration.

Applicants should also provide a copy of the product labels (e.g. outer carton,
product insert) of the reference product used in the BE study for verification
purposes.

It is highly recommended that the generic or test product used in the BE study be
the same as the drug product submitted for registration in Singapore. If this cannot
be fulfilled, then applicants should refer to Appendix 10 Product Interchangeability
and Biowaiver Request for Chemical Generic Drug Applications for more
information regarding eligibility and documentary requirements.

In instances when the reference product used in the BE study is not the Singapore
reference product, if the criteria listed in section 2 of Appendix 10 are fulfilled, then
the following additional documents must be submitted in support of the application:


(a) A comparative table that lists the qualitative composition of both the BE and
Singapore reference products;
(b) Comparative dissolution profiles between the BE and Singapore reference
products; and
(c) Comparative dissolution profiles between the BE test and Singapore reference
products.

For Biopharmaceutics Classification System (BCS)-based biowaiver applications,
justifications and relevant supporting documents should also be included under
section 3.2.P.9.

Product Interchangeability _–_ Comparative Dissolution Profile (CTD section
3.2.P.9.2)
Comparative dissolution profile data between the generic product and the
Singapore reference product should be submitted in support of the following GDAs:
- POMs (immediate and modified release oral solid dosage forms); and
- P or GSL medicines (modified release oral solid dosage forms only).

For POMs supported by BE study data, the following additional comparative
dissolution profile data should be submitted (applicable only when the BE reference
product is not the Singapore reference product):
(a) Between the reference and test products used in the BE study; and
(b) Between the BE and Singapore reference products.

Applicants should also provide a copy of the product labels (e.g. outer carton,
product insert) of the BE and Singapore reference products used in the comparative
dissolution profile testing for verification purposes.

When a generic product is to be marketed in several strengths, applicants should
refer to Section 3 of Appendix 10 Product Interchangeability and Biowaiver Request
for Chemical Generic Drug Applications for more information on comparative
dissolution profile testing requirements.


For BCS-based biowaiver applications, justifications and relevant supporting
documents should also be included under section 3.2.P.9.

Applicants should be familiar with Appendix 10 Product Interchangeability and
Biowaiver Request for Chemical Generic Drug Applications.

HSA reserves the right to request for any additional information required to
determine the product interchangeability of the generic product to the Singapore
reference product.

#### 18.4 Non-clinical and Clinical Documents

Generally, non-clinical (animal) and clinical (human) data are not required to be
included in a GDA. Instead, the data demonstrating the generic product’s
interchangeability with the Singapore reference product, e.g. in vivo BE and
comparative dissolution studies, are required for submission.

Documentary requirements for establishing product interchangeability (including
BCS-based biowaiver applications) can be found in Appendix 10 Product
Interchangeability and Biowaiver Request for Chemical Generic Drug Applications.

Where required, HSA may request for RMPs to be submitted on a case-by-case
basis for GDAs, following the evaluation of the safety profile of the product
described in the product application. Guidance on RMP submission requirements
can be found in Appendix 16 Guideline on the Submission of Risk Management
Plan Documents.

#### 18.5 Specific documentary requirements for each evaluation route

##### 18.5.1 Abridged Evaluation Route

All aspects of the product’s quality which include, but are not limited to, the
formulation, site(s) of manufacture, release and shelf life specifications and primary
packaging should be the same as that approved by the drug regulatory agency that
issued the proof of approval.


The technical documents required include:
- complete quality documents for both the drug substance and drug product; and
- BE studies or justifications for applying a biowaiver, where applicable.

##### 18.5.2 Verification and Verification-CECA Evaluation Routes

The complete assessment report and other relevant supporting documents from the
chosen reference drug regulatory agency must be submitted, as tabulated below.
The assessment reports must be unredacted or unedited, and should include
details of imposed licensing conditions, final product labelling, chemistry and clinical
reviews, and other information in relation to the product’s approval. Reports
obtained from the public domain are deemed unacceptable.

Applications submitted to HSA without the unredacted/ unedited reports from the
primary reference agency will not qualify for the verification evaluation route. The
applicant will be required to withdraw and resubmit the application via the abridged
route if the applicant intends to pursue the application.

drug regulatory agency and Sponsor; and

- Any additional documents to demonstrate product interchangeability with the
Singapore reference product as described in section 18.3.2 Body of Data _–_ Drug
Product, where applicable.

Applicants are reminded that generic products applied through the verification and
verification-CECA evaluation routes must still demonstrate product
interchangeability to the Singapore reference product.

Data submitted to HSA must be the same as the data package submitted to the
reference regulatory agencies. Differences between the dossier submitted to HSA
and data reviewed by the reference drug regulatory agencies will not only delay the
processing of the application, but may also lead to re-routing of the dossier to the
abridged evaluation route if significant undisclosed differences are discovered.

In addition, the BE test product must be manufactured at the same drug substance
and drug product manufacturing sites by the same manufacturing processes as
submitted in the GDA application dossier.


##### Therapeutic Products 18.6 Documentary Requirements for Second Brand Registration of Chemical

```
Chemical Therapeutic Products
```
##### 18.6.1 Definition

A second brand product refers to a chemical drug product which is identical to a
registered (original) drug product in all aspects of quality, safety and efficacy at the
time of its submission for market authorisation and is submitted by the same product
registrant of the original drug product.

##### 18.6.2 Documentary Requirements

18.6.2.1 Administrative

A complete set of administrative documents as per section 1 8 .1 Administrative
documents has to be submitted. In addition, a declaration that the second brand
product is identical to the original drug product in terms of quality, safety and
efficacy is required.

18.6.2.2 Quality

A complete set of quality documents as per sections 1 8 .2 CTD overview and
summaries and 18 .3 Quality documents has to be submitted. In addition, a
comparative table of each CTD section between the second brand and original drug
products is required and all differences between these two dossiers should be
stated. The impact of these differences (if any) should generally be justified by the
approval or submission of minor variation application - MIV (to state application
number) to the original product dossier (see Chapter H – Minor Variation (MIV)
Application Submission).

During the evaluation stage, if MIV has not been submitted for these differences to
the original drug product dossier, then a MIV-2 application will be requested to
update the original product dossier. A stop-clock will be imposed on the second
brand product application until the update is completed. Product registrant is
advised to file MIV for the update of these differences prior to submission to avoid
any delay in the review process of the second brand product.


Submission of BE studies are generally not required for second brand product
applications if the original product was granted marketing authorisation based on
the evaluation of the product’s quality, safety and efficacy. However if the original
product was registered as a generic drug product before 01 April 2004, prior to the
implementation of BE requirements, the current BE requirements will apply to the
second brand product.


## Chapter E - Biosimilar Product Application Submission

This chapter applies to new drug applications for biosimilar products.

A biosimilar product is a biological therapeutic product demonstrated to be similar,
in physicochemical characteristics, biological activity, safety and efficacy to an
existing registered biological product.

Applicants submitting applications to register biosimilar products must be familiar
with the responsibilities of managing these products throughout their life cycle.
Thus, it is recommended to refer to Appendix 15 Guidance on Registration of
Biosimilar Products or HSA’s website for more information.

This chapter serves to provide additional guidance on submission of biosimilar
products.

### 19 APPLICATION TYPES

Biosimilar products are eligible for the NDA-2 and NDA-3 application types. When
selecting the Product Type in PRISM section 3.2, select ‘Biological Drug’.

```
NDA New Drug Application
```
###### NDA-1:

```
Not applicable to biosimilar products.
```
###### NDA-2:

```
For the first strength of a biosimilar product with the same dosage form
and route of administration as the Singapore reference biological
product.
```
###### NDA-3:

```
For subsequent strength(s) of a biosimilar product that has been registered
or has been submitted as an NDA-2. The product name, dosage form,
indication, dosing regimen and patient population should be the same as
that for the NDA-2.
```

#### 19.1 Biosimilar Product

A biosimilar product is intended to be similar in terms of quality, safety and efficacy
to a registered biological product (reference biological product) for which there is
substantial evidence of safety and efficacy.

Applicants are advised to search HSA’s Register of Therapeutic Products to identify
the Singapore registered biological product (Singapore reference biological
product; see section 1 9 .2 below).

The standard generic approach of bioequivalence demonstration with reference to
a chemically-derived drug product is scientifically inappropriate for biosimilar
product applications since biological drugs are much more complex in their structure
and inherent properties as compared to chemically-derived drugs. The biosimilar
product approach, based on comparability (demonstration of similarity), should be
followed.

The development of a biosimilar product involves stepwise comparability exercises
starting with the comparison of the quality characteristics of the biosimilar product
and the reference biological product. The demonstration of similarity in terms of
quality is a prerequisite for the reduction of the non-clinical and clinical dataset
required for registration. However, if relevant differences are found in the quality,
non-clinical and/or clinical data, the product is unlikely to qualify as a biosimilar
product and a more extensive non-clinical and clinical dataset may be required to
support registration.

#### 19.2 Singapore Reference Biological Product

The following are considerations for the choice of a biological reference product:
- The reference product should be a biological therapeutic product that is currently
registered in Singapore (hereinafter known as ‘Singapore reference biological
product’). A registered biosimilar product cannot be used as a reference product.
- The active substance(s) of the biosimilar product and the Singapore reference
biological product should be similar in molecular and biological terms;


```
- The pharmaceutical form, strength and route of administration of the biosimilar
product should be the same as the Singapore reference biological product. Any
differences will require additional comparability assessment data and have to be
justified by appropriate studies; and
- The conditions of use for the biosimilar product must fall within the directions for
use (including indication(s), dosing regimen(s) and patient group(s)) of the
Singapore reference biological product.
```
```
A biological product with no suitable Singapore reference biological product will not
qualify for registration as a biosimilar product in Singapore.
```
### 20 EVALUATION ROUTES

```
A biosimilar product is only eligible for the abridged evaluation route. The product
must have been approved by at least one of the following reference drug regulatory
agencies: EU EMA, Australia TGA, UK MHRA, US FDA and Health Canada.
```
### 21 DOCUMENTARY REQUIREMENTS

Applicants are advised to refer to the Appendix 15 Guidance on Registration of
Biosimilar Products for detailed information on the complete requirements for
registering a biosimilar product.
```
#### 21.1 Administrative Documents

```
The administrative documents of the application dossier for biosimilar products is
the same as that described in section 15.1 Administrative Documents in Chapter C
New Drug Application Submission.
```
#### 21.2 CTD Overviews and Summaries

```
The CTD overviews and summaries are the same as that described in section 15.2
in Chapter C New Drug Application Submission.
```
#### 21.3 Quality Documents.............................................................................

```
The full set of quality documents (i.e. Module 3 of ICH CTD or Part II of ACTD)
should be submitted.
```
```
Data submitted should include extensive drug substance and drug product
characterisation and quality comparability data between the biosimilar product and
the Singapore reference biological product. The comparability exercise should
encompass both the drug substance and the drug product and should also take the
following into consideration:
- the complexity of the molecular structure;
```

- the types of changes introduced in the manufacturing process during
development; and
- the impact on quality, safety and efficacy.

#### 21.4 Non-Clinical and Clinical Documents

Non-clinical and clinical data generated with the biosimilar product are required.

The amount of non-clinical and clinical data required will depend on:
- the product or class of products;
- the extent of characterisation which is possible to undertake when using state-
of-the-art analytical methods;
- observed or potential differences between the biosimilar product and the
reference biological product; and
- the clinical experience with the product class.

A case-by-case approach is needed for each class of products.

Submission of RMPs in support of all biosimilar applications is mandatory.
Guidance on risk management plan submission requirements can be found in
Appendix 16 Guideline on the Submission of Risk Management Plan Documents.


## Chapter F - Post-Approval Process

Throughout the life cycle of a therapeutic product, changes to a product’s efficacy,
quality and/or safety are likely to occur. HSA must be notified of any changes to a
product’s safety, efficacy or quality through an application process – i.e. the
variation application.

### 22 APPLICATION TYPES

Figure 5 is a schematic diagram illustrating the various types of variation
applications:

There are two types of variation applications – major variation applications (MAV)
and minor variation applications (MIV). The different variations and application
types are described as follows:

```

```
Figure 5 Schematic diagram of variation application routes.
```

```
MAV Major Variation application for an existing registered product.
```
###### MAV-1:

```
Any variation to the approved indication(s), dosing regimen(s), patient
group(s), and/or inclusion of clinical information extending the usage of the
product (e.g. clinical trial information related to an unapproved indication,
dosing regimen and/or patient population; recommendations for
concomitant administration of vaccines; additional bacterial strains with
clinical (in vivo) data to expand the indication(s) for antimicrobial products;
additional viral serotypes/genotypes to expand the indication(s) for antiviral
products, etc.).
```
```
MAV-2: A change in the current approved forensic classification, also known as
reclassification.
```
```
MIV Minor Variation application for an existing registered product
```
###### MIV-1:

```
A minor variation to the quality aspects, i.e. chemistry, manufacturing
controls and/or product labelling.
```
###### MIV-2:

```
A minor variation or an administrative change.
```
HSA may re-categorise the application type if appropriate. Applicants are to note
that, in PRISM, the re-categorisation of an application (e.g. MIV to MAV-1, MIV-2 to
MIV- 1 , or vice versa) may require the withdrawal of the original application.
Applicants will be notified if they are required to resubmit the application according
to the correct category.

All applications require HSA’s approval before the change(s) can be implemented,
with the exception of MIV-2 applications, where the change(s) can be implemented
if there is no objection from HSA within the notification timeline (refer to Appendix 5
Target Processing Timeline for notification timeline).


### 23 VARIATION APPLICATION PROCESS

The steps to follow when submitting an MAV or MIV are similar to those for
submitting an NDA or GDA, as seen in Figure 6 :

```
* Application Screening is only applicable for MAV- 1 and MAV- 2 applications.
a An acceptance notice will not be sent for MIV-2 applications.
b A regulatory decision letter will not be sent for MIV-2 applications.
```
However, each variation application has distinct differences and the applicant
should be familiar with the variation application process in order to facilitate the
process.

For information on the variation application processing time, refer to Appendix 5
Target Processing Timeline of this guidance document.

#### 23.1 Pre-Submission Preparation

Applicants are advised to ensure that all the requirements for the variation
application are met before submitting the application.

Applicants are encouraged to contact HSA prior to the submission of a variation
application if there are questions regarding the application. There are two methods
to contact HSA:

(a) Pre-submission Enquiry via the online feedback form on the HSA website; and
(b) Pre-submission Consultation/ Notification.

Applicants are to note that all advice given by HSA will be based on knowledge that
is current at the time of the consultation. Such advice is not binding and does not
have a direct bearing on the eventual outcome of the application concerned.

##### 23.1.1 Pre-Submission Enquiry

The applicant may submit a Pre-Submission Enquiry via the online feedback form
on the HSA website if any clarification on submitting an MAV application is needed
prior to submission.

For issues relating to MIV submissions, the applicant should submit a completed
MIV Filing and Submission Enquiry Form (Appendix 12 ) via the online feedback
form on the HSA website.

##### 23.1.2 Pre-Submission Meeting/ Notification

An applicant may request for a pre-submission meeting if a face-to-face
consultation with HSA is necessary to address specific submission issues. The
request should be made in writing, stating the purpose, agenda and proposed date
and time for the meeting, via the online feedback form on the HSA website.


The meeting request should be made at least 3 weeks prior to the meeting date,
and relevant meeting documents (e.g. presentation slides, briefing documents, etc.)
should be provided at least 1 week before the meeting.

A pre-submission meeting is not compulsory for an application filed via the full
evaluation route (see section 2 4 .1 Evaluation Routes for more information on MAV-
1 evaluation routes). Nonetheless, the applicant is required to notify HSA at least
two months prior to the intended submission date. The notification can be sent via
the online feedback form on the HSA website, and should include information on
the product name (if available), active ingredient(s), summaries of the clinical data
(e.g. Overviews), planned submissions in other countries, and planned date of
submission to HSA.

#### 23.2 Application Submission

The submission of an application comprises two key steps – (i) online submission
of the application form via PRISM and (ii) submission of the technical dossier.

##### 23.2.1 PRISM Application Form

The procedure for submitting the variation application through PRISM is similar to
that for a NDA or GDA, although some fields in the PRISM application form are
disabled for variation applications.

Applicants should refer to Appendix 17 Guideline on PRISM Submission for further
details.

##### 23.2.2 Variation Application Dossier

The technical dossier accompanying the application should be submitted within 2
working days of the PRISM application submission to prevent delays in the
processing of the application. The date of receipt of the actual technical dossier
by HSA will be taken as the submission date where the processing time starts.

The dossier submitted for variation applications should be in the same CTD format
as that used for the original new product application.


Application checklists for both ICH CTD and ACTD dossiers are provided in
Appendix 2B and 3B, respectively, to guide applicants on the submission
requirements and to ensure completeness of the dossier. Each MAV application
must be accompanied by a checklist duly completed by the applicant and
attached in PRISM.

23.2.2.1 Submission Requirements

The complete application dossier – i.e. Modules 1 to 5 of the ICH CTD or Parts I to
IV of the ACTD – must be submitted in an electronic format.

All documents required under Module 1/Part I must be submitted in softcopy in
PRISM. Colour scanned copy of the original documents should be submitted and
original hardcopy of documents are not required. However, HSA reserves the rights
to request for the submission of the original or certified true copy of the submitted
document if there is any doubt that the submitted scanned document is not an
accurate reflection of the original document.

Please refer to section 23.2.2.3 for more information on certifying non-original
documents if the original documents cannot be provided.

For Modules 2 to 5/Parts II to IV, applicants can opt to attach the documents either
in full into PRISM section 7 (Supporting Attachments) or submit the softcopies (e.g.
PDF format) in a CD/DVD.

For submission requirements for MIV applications, please refer to Appendix 13 and
Appendix 14 for registered chemical products and registered biological products,
respectively.

Submitting a CD or DVD
When submitting a CD/DVD, applicants are encouraged to organise the dossier (i.e.
folders and subfolders) according to the CTD format and to include bookmarks in
all documents to facilitate retrieval of documents.


Files containing the below scripts will not be accepted due to cybersecurity reasons:

The CD/DVD should be properly labelled with the following information:
- PRISM application number;
- PRISM submission date;
- Product name;
- Application type; and
- Contents of the CD/DVD (e.g. Module 2 and 5).

Applicants must ensure the access to the content of CD/DVD. For protected files,
password(s) must be provided as appropriate.

Upon acceptance of the application for evaluation, applicants will be notified if
additional copies of clinical documents (in CD/DVD) will be required.

23.2.2.2 Language and Translation

All documents submitted in support of an application to HSA must be in English.
For documents in original language which is not English, a certified translation or a
verified translation may be acceptable.

```
```
Refer to the sample verification document for
translator enclosed in Appendix 4.
```
23.2.2.3 Certifying non-original documents

If the softcopy official document (e.g. CPP, GMP certificate, etc.) submitted to HSA
in PRISM is not a scan of the original document, the document must be certified
prior to submission. A certified true copy certifies that the photocopy presented is a
true and accurate copy of the original document. Acceptable certification of
documents to support drug product applications to HSA can be done by the
Company Director or Company Secretary as registered with ACRA or above, or by
an independent authority such as a lawyer, notary public, Commissioner for
Oaths/Declarations/Affidavits, Justice of Peace, the original issuer of the document


or Embassy/Consulate. A notarised and authenticated copy is the same as a
certified true copy.

A certified true copy of approval letters requires certification by the drug regulatory
agency that issued the approval letter, notary public or Singapore
Embassy/Consulate in the country where the approval letter was issued.
Certification of approval letters is not required in the event the approval letter is
available on the drug regulatory agency’s website. In this instance, applicants
should provide the internet address (URL) for validation by HSA.

#### 23.3 Application Screening

The screening process is applicable to MAV-1 and MAV-2 applications, and is
similar to that for an application for a new therapeutic product.

The application will be screened to ensure the correctness of the application type
and the completeness of the dossier. The date of receipt of the application
dossier (i.e. the technical dossier [e.g. in a CD/DVD] including the application
checklist) will be taken as the submission date and the start of the screening
timeline.

During screening, if an application is identified to be more appropriately submitted
under a different application type, the applicant will be informed of this change and
the necessary actions to effect this change via an Input Request. More information
on the change in application type is described in section 23.6.2.1 Changes to
Application Types and Re-routing of Evaluation During Screening.

An MAV application submitted without the clinical dossier or an application
submitted via the verification route without assessment reports will not be screened,
as screening cannot proceed without the dossier. An Input Request will be issued
to the applicant to withdraw the application.

Applicants are also advised to ensure that the dossier is compiled according to the
required format. Failure to adhere to the required CTD format will lead to the non-
acceptance of the dossier without screening.


If the dossier submitted is considered to be otherwise incomplete, a screening query
stating the deficiencies will be issued via PRISM (Input Request) to the applicant.
The stop-clock starts when an Input Request is sent and ends upon receipt of a
complete and satisfactory response to the query. For MAV applications, the total
number of Input Requests sent during screening is capped at two. Applicants will
be given 20 working days to respond to each Input Request, starting from the date
the Input Request is sent.

The application will only be accepted when all deficiencies have been adequately
addressed and HSA is satisfied that the dossier is complete for evaluation. An
acceptance notice will then be issued via PRISM and the date of acceptance of the
application will be taken as the start of the evaluation timeline. For certain types,
applicants would be required to submit additional copies of the dossier in CD/DVD
format after acceptance.

If the applicant fails to address the deficiencies raised during screening, the dossier
is considered incomplete for evaluation. An Input Request will be issued to the
applicant to withdraw the application. If the application is subsequently re-
submitted, it will be processed as a new application.

For MIV- 1 applications, applicants will receive an “Acceptance” notification sent
within 3 working days after submission of an MIV-1 application via PRISM. For
applications submitted under an incorrect application type (e.g. MAV-1 changes
submitted as a MIV-1), applicants will be requested to withdraw the application
during evaluation.

#### 23.4 Application Evaluation and Regulatory Decision

The evaluation process for a variation application is similar to that for an application
for a new therapeutic product.

```
NOTE: The screening process only checks for completeness of the application dossier
for evaluation. The acceptance of the dossier for evaluation does not denote the
adequacy of the data for regulatory approval.
```

Once the application is accepted, the evaluation stage begins. Evaluation queries
may be issued via Input Request to the applicant if clarification or additional
information is required.

The stop-clock starts whenever HSA issues a query and ends upon the receipt of a
complete and satisfactory response from the applicant.

In situations where the applicant is unable to provide a complete response within
the specified timeframe, the applicant should notify HSA as soon as possible after
receiving HSA’s queries. The application will be considered withdrawn if the
applicant fails to observe the specified response deadline.

Applicants are reminded that the submission of additional supporting data not
requested by HSA following the acceptance of the application will not be
considered, unless prior arrangement with HSA is made for the submission
concerned. During the evaluation process, HSA may assess that the application is
more suitably evaluated via an alternative route, in which case the application will
be re-routed to the appropriate route. Any re-routing of the application will be
discussed with the applicant.

HSA may engage external evaluators, experts and advisory committees in the
evaluation process, when necessary. These experts include scientists and
clinicians from both local and overseas institutions. All external evaluators and
experts are bound by agreement to protect the information made available to them.
The identity of the external evaluators is kept confidential.

For MAV-1 applications (full and abridged evaluation routes), applicants can check
on the progress of the evaluation and may view the evaluation stage via
Track@PRISM. Table 10 describes the stages of the evaluation process for MAV-
1 applications.

Applicants are also notified via system-generated emails whenever an evaluation
stage change occurs.

The regulatory decision process for a variation application is also similar to that for
an application for a new therapeutic product. However, a regulatory decision will
not be issued for MIV-2 applications as these are notifiable changes.

Upon approval/notification of a variation application, the product registration
information in PRISM will be updated to reflect the changes (if applicable).
Registrants may refer to Enquire@PRISM to view the latest product registration
information of their products.

#### 23.5 Target Processing Timelines

Please refer to Appendix 5 for information on target processing timelines for the
different application types and evaluation routes.

#### 23.6 Fees

As the fees may be subject to revision from time to time, applicants are advised to
visit the HSA website for updated information on fees.

Payment can be made via GIRO or other electronic payment modes such as eNets
or eCredit card.

##### 23.6.1 Screening Fee

The screening fee is only applicable for MAV-1 applications and is payable at the
time of online submission via PRISM. The screening fee is non-refundable once the
application is submitted via PRISM.

For payment via GIRO, the screening fee will be debited upon the successful
submission of an online application.

For payment via other electronic payment modes (i.e. eNets or eCredit card), the
screening fee must be paid before the application is considered successfully
submitted online.

A screening fee is not applicable for other types of variation applications.

```
NOTE: Applicants are strongly encouraged to apply for a GIRO account (click here for
GIRO application form) with HSA to facilitate payments for future submissions and
subsequent payment for retention fee for the registered products.
```

##### 23.6.2 Evaluation Fee

There are two different evaluation fees for MAV-1 applications:
(a) Evaluation fees for a single-strength product or the first product in a series of
products of different strengths; and
(b) Evaluation fees for each subsequent product in a series of products of different
strengths.

An evaluation fee for a MAV-1 application is payable upon the acceptance of the
dossier for evaluation and is non-refundable once the application is accepted.

An evaluation fee for a MIV-1 application is payable upon the submission of the
application in PRISM and is non-refundable.

For payments via GIRO, the evaluation fee will be debited upon the acceptance of
the application.

For payments via other electronic payment modes (i.e. eNets or eCredit card), the
evaluation fee will be collected together with the screening fee. In the event that the
application is not accepted for evaluation, the fee collected will be refunded to the
applicant’s bank account.

Applicants may opt for the progressive payment scheme. This is an opt-in scheme
eligible for applicants who make payment via GIRO and is only applicable to the
application types listed in Table 11 :

progressive) cannot be amended. Applicants who wish to change their selected
payment scheme will have to withdraw and re-submit the application(s); and any
upfront payment made (e.g. screening fee) are non-refundable.

For applications under the progressive payment scheme, in the event that the
application is withdrawn during the evaluation stage, any fees that had been
charged, but not debited from the GIRO account would remain payable. Any paid
fee is non-refundable.

23.6.2.1 Changes to Application Types and Re-routing of Evaluation During
Screening

If an application type or evaluation route is incorrectly selected, applicants will be
informed via an Input Request. Such changes may result in a different evaluation
fee upon acceptance of the application.

In the situation where the applicant decides not to pursue the application due to the
said changes, the screening fee is not refundable.

For applications which require withdrawal and resubmission, the screening fee is
not refundable. Applicants may wish to seek clarification on appropriate application
type or evaluation route via the online feedback form on the HSA website prior to
the submission.

23.6.2.2 Change of Application between Different Application Types

This refers to a change in the application type between MAV-1, MAV- 2 , MIV-1 or
MIV-2.

The applicant will be required to withdraw and resubmit the application if the
applicant intends to pursue the application.


23.6.2.3 Change of Evaluation Route

This refers to a change in evaluation route (e.g. Full to Abridged, Verification to
Abridged, Abridged to Verification, etc.).

The applicant will be required to withdraw and resubmit the application if the
applicant intends to pursue the application.


## Chapter G - Major Variation (MAV) Application Submission

This chapter applies to major variation applications for currently registered
products.

### 24 MAV-1 APPLICATIONS

An MAV-1 application applies to variations to any of the following:
(a) approved indication(s);
(b) approved dosing regimen(s);
(c) approved patient group(s); and/or
(d) inclusion of clinical information extending the usage of the product – for
example, clinical trial information related to an unapproved indication, dosing
regimen and/or patient population; recommendation for concomitant
administration of vaccines; additional bacterial strains with clinical (in vivo) data
to expand the indication(s) for antimicrobial products; additional viral
serotypes/genotypes to expand the indication(s) for antiviral products, etc.

For each product registration, applicants may submit up to a maximum of three
concurrent MAV-1 applications at any one time.

#### 24.1 Evaluation Routes

There are three evaluation routes for an MAV- 1 – full, abridged and verification
evaluation routes. The eligibility criteria and documentary requirements are different
for each evaluation route.

##### 24.1.1 Full Evaluation Route

Full evaluation will apply to a major variation that has not been approved by any
drug regulatory agency at the time of submission.

For a submission under the full evaluation route, the applicant is required to notify
HSA via the online feedback form on the HSA website at least two months prior to
the intended submission date of the application dossier. The notification should
include information on the product name (if available), active ingredient(s),
summaries of the quality, non-clinical and clinical data (e.g. Overviews), planned
submissions in other countries, and the planned date of submission to HSA.

##### 24.1.2 Abridged Evaluation Route

Abridged evaluation applies to a major variation that has been evaluated and
approved by at least one drug regulatory agency. The proposed variation – i.e. the
proposed indication(s), dosing regimen(s), patient group(s) and/or clinical
information – should be the same as that approved by the regulatory agency that
issued the proof of approval.

##### 24.1.3 Verification Evaluation Route

Similar to an NDA, at least two of HSA’s reference drug regulatory agencies must
have evaluated and approved the major variation. However, approval by these
reference regulatory agencies does not oblige HSA to approve the application.

One of the reference drug regulatory agencies must be declared as the primary
reference agency. The chosen primary reference agency is defined as the
reference drug regulatory agency from which the qualifying supporting documents
(as outlined in this guidance) will be submitted and which approved the strictest
indication(s), dosing regimen(s), patient groups(s) and/or direction(s) for use among
the two reference drug regulatory agencies which approved the variation.

Additional eligibility criteria for the verification route include:


```
 The application must be submitted within three years from the date of approval
by the chosen primary reference agency;
 The product does not need a more stringent assessment as a result of
differences in local disease patterns and/or medical practices (e.g. some anti-
infectives); and
 The product and its intended use – i.e. indication(s), dosing regimen(s) and
patient group(s) – have not been rejected, withdrawn, approved via appeal
process or pending deferral by a drug regulatory agency for safety and/or
efficacy reasons.
```
The proposed indication(s), dosing regimen(s), patient group(s) and/or direction(s)
for use should be the most stringent amongst those approved by the reference
regulatory agencies.

For a product with a proposed indication that has been designated as an Orphan
Drug by at least one reference drug regulatory agency or a product that has been
approved by at least one reference drug regulatory agency via an accelerated/fast-
track approval, approval under exceptional circumstances or equivalent approval
process, the applicant should consult HSA on the eligibility of such a product
through the verification route prior to its submission. Please refer to section 2 3 .1
Pre-submission Preparation for the available channels to consult HSA.

**Non-clinical overview only, if applicable.**

##### 24.2.1 Administrative Documents

The three evaluation routes for an MAV-1 share the same documentary
requirements for CTD Module 1/Part I. The documents required are:

(a) Section 1.1 – Comprehensive Table of Contents;

(b) Section 1.2 – Introduction – including the Table of Amendment Details of PRISM
section 0.5;
(c) Section 1.3 – PRISM application form;
(d) Section 1.4 – Labelling, Package Insert and Patient Information Leaflet – both
the proposed and currently approved Singapore product labels and PI/PIL are
required. For the proposed labelling/PI/PIL, a pristine and an annotated version
(which highlights the changes made to the currently approved labelling) are
required. Annotations should be made on the proposed labelling materials
based on the actual text to be added, and on current approved labelling
materials. Current approved text proposed for deletion should be struck through,
whereas newly added and proposed text should be underlined or highlighted.
Current approved text that is not intended to be deleted should not be annotated.
However, the translocation of current approved text from one section to another
can be allowed in its entirety.
(e) Section 1.5 – Approved SPC/PI/PIL from the drug regulatory agency that issued
the proof of approval and from each of HSA’s reference drug regulatory
agencies (where applicable);
(f) Section 1.6 – Assessment Report from Reference Agencies – only for
verification route (see section 24.2.5.3 Verification Evaluation Route);
(g) Sections 1.8, 1.9 – Proof of Approval – for an MAV-1, the official approval
letter(s) must contain information on the requested Singapore variation. For the

```

verification evaluation route, the approval letters issued by at least two reference
drug regulatory agencies, including the chosen primary reference agency,
should be submitted;
(h) Section 1.13 – Declaration on rejection, withdrawal and deferral; and
(i) Section 1.15 – Registration Status in Other Countries.

##### 24.2.2 CTD Overviews and Summaries

The following documents are to be submitted:
- a non-clinical overview, if applicable; and
- a clinical overview and summaries of clinical efficacy and clinical safety.

##### 24.2.3 Quality Documents

Quality documents (Module 3/Part II) are not required for MAV-1 applications.

##### 24.2.4 Non-clinical and Clinical Documents

Each evaluation route will have different non-clinical and clinical documentary
requirements. Refer to section 24 .2.5 Specific Documentary Requirements for Each
Evaluation Route below for more information.

For MAV applications, HSA may request for RMPs to be submitted on a case-by-
case basis following the evaluation of the safety concerns described in the product
application, where necessary. For such instances, please refer to the guidance on
RMP submission requirements found in Appendix 1 6 Guideline on the Submission
of Risk Management Plan Documents.

If the MAV-1 is for a non-prescription medicine and is submitted via the abridged
evaluation route, the applicant may submit a written request for a waiver of clinical
data submission. Eligibility for a waiver is subject to the criteria defined in Appendix
6 Guideline on Submission for Non-Prescription Therapeutic Products. However,
HSA may request for the complete clinical data set if it is deemed appropriate.


24.2.5 Specific Documentary Requirements for Each Evaluation Route

24.2.5.1 Full Evaluation Route

The technical documents required include:
- complete non-clinical documents, if applicable; and
- complete clinical documents; i.e. all study reports from phase I to phase III,
including tables and appendices.

24.2.5.2 Abridged Evaluation Route

The technical documents required include:
- a non-clinical overview, if applicable; and
- a clinical overview, summaries of clinical efficacy and clinical safety, synopses
of relevant studies, a tabular listing of the clinical development programme and
study reports of the pivotal studies (the tables and appendices to the pivotal
study reports may be submitted upon request by HSA).

24.2.5.3 Verification Evaluation Route

The complete assessment report and other relevant supporting documents from the
chosen primary reference agency must be submitted, as tabulated below. The
assessment reports from the primary reference agency must be unredacted or
unedited, and should include details of imposed licensing conditions, final product
labelling, clinical reviews, and other information in relation to the product’s approval.
Reports obtained from the public domain are deemed unacceptable.

Applications submitted to HSA without the unredacted/ unedited reports from the
primary reference agency will not qualify for the verification evaluation route. The
applicant will be required to withdraw and resubmit the application via the abridged
route if the applicant intends to pursue the application.

All of the data submitted to HSA must be the same as the data package submitted
to the reference drug regulatory agencies. Differences between the dossier
submitted to HSA and data reviewed by the reference drug regulatory agencies will
not only delay the processing of the application, but may also lead to the re-routing
of the dossier to the abridged evaluation route if significant undisclosed differences
are discovered.

### 25 MAV-2 APPLICATIONS

An MAV-2 application applies to variations involving a change in forensic
classification of a registered product, otherwise known as “reclassification”.
Examples of reclassification include from POM to P or from P to GSL. Applicants
are advised to refer to section 1. 2 Forensic classification for more information.

If an MAV-2 application is riding on a previous reclassification of an analogous
product, then the applicant may submit a ‘me-too’ reclassification (see section
25.2.1 'Me-too' Reclassification). Reclassification may also be undertaken when
experience gained shows that there is a need to supervise the use of a product –
i.e. from GSL to P or POM.

More information on reclassified medicines may be found on the HSA website.

#### 25.1 Evaluation Routes

Only the abridged evaluation route applies for MAV-2 applications.

#### 25.2 Eligibility Criteria

A change of forensic classification of a POM or P drug product to a less stringent
classification may be considered if the following criteria are met:

(a) The use of the product has been sufficiently extensive;


(b) The product has been marketed for a period of time sufficient to establish a post-
marketing adverse event profile;
(c) The product’s safety profile gives no cause for concern during the marketing
period; and
(d) The product is presented in an appropriate pack size with consumer-friendly
labelling (PIL/outer carton).

Applicants who wish to submit a request for the reclassification of a therapeutic
product should provide justifications based on the following information:
(a) The forensic classification and approved indication(s) and dosing regimen(s) of
the product in the UK, US, Canada and Australia, where applicable

(b) The period of product registration in Singapore, UK, US, Canada and Australia,
where applicable, with specific information on its forensic classification (i.e.
POM, P and/or GSL) and duration of sale in that classification;

(c) The period of actual product sale in Singapore;

(d) The rationale for requesting a change in the forensic classification;

(e) Patient exposure to the product and its safety profile based on worldwide
spontaneous adverse drug reaction reports, data from post-marketing
surveillance studies, clinical trials, published literature and locally reported
adverse drug reactions; and

(f) Potential problems and hazards arising from the inappropriate use of the
product.

##### 25.2.1 ‘Me-too’ Reclassification

A ‘me-too’ reclassification will be considered if the forensic classification of the
product is to be aligned with that of a similar product with the same active ingredient
and intended use.

#### 25.3 Documentary Requirements

One set of documents, as outlined in the checklists in Appendix 2B or Appendix 3B,
should be submitted in softcopy.


The documentary requirements for an MAV-2 submission include:

(i) Section 1.1 – Comprehensive Table of Contents;
(ii) Section 1.2 – Introduction – including the justification for reclassification, as
listed above, and the Table of Amendment Details of PRISM section 0.5;
(iii) Section 1.3 – PRISM Application Form;
(iv) Section 1.4 – Product Labels – the proposed product labels/PIL should also be
submitted, if applicable;
(v) Section 1.5 – Approved SPC/PI/PIL;
(vi) Section 1.8 – Proof of Approval – proof of the approved indication(s) and dosing
regimen(s) for the reclassified product in the UK, US, Canada and/or Australia;
(vii) Section 1.15 – Registration Status in Other Countries; and,
(viii) Module 2/Part IV – Summary of Clinical Safety – the summary should include
the following:
(i) The forensic classification of the product in the UK, US, Canada and
Australia, with specific information on its forensic classification and duration
of sale in that classification;
(ii) The experience of patient exposure to the product – e.g. sales volume,
patient-years;
(iii) A summary of the product safety profile based on worldwide and local
spontaneous adverse drug reaction reports, post-marketing surveillance
data, clinical trials and published literature;
(iv) A list of the potential problems arising from using the product without
medical supervision; and
(v) An analysis of the hazards arising from therapeutic misuse or drug abuse,
whether deliberate or accidental e.g. consequence of delay in seeking
medical attention.

##### 25.3.1 ‘Me-too’ Reclassification

The documentary requirements for a ‘me-too’ reclassification application include:

(a) Section 1.1 – Comprehensive Table of Contents;
(b) Section 1.2 – Introduction – including the justification for reclassification , and
the Table of Amendment Details of PRISM section 0.5;


(c) Section 1.3 – PRISM Application Form;
(d) Section 1.4 – Product Labels – the proposed product labels/PIL should also be
submitted, if applicable; and
(e) Section 1.5 – Approved SPC/PI/PIL, if applicable.

The Summary of Clinical Safety in Module 2/Part IV is not required.


## Chapter H - Minor Variation (MIV) Application Submission

This chapter applies to minor variation applications for currently registered
products.

### 26 APPLICATION TYPES

There are two types of minor variation application types:

```
MIV-1: A minor variation to the quality aspects, i.e. chemistry, manufacturing
controls and/or product labelling.
MIV-2: A minor variation or an administrative change.
```
### 27 APPLICATION SUBMISSION

Applicants should be familiar with the guidelines and documentary requirements
described in Appendix 1 3 (chemical) and Appendix 14 (biologics) before submitting
minor variation applications.

There are two submission routes – abridged or verification route.

An application may be submitted via the verification route if:
(i) The proposed variation(s) must be identical to those approved by one of
HSA’s reference agencies; and
(ii) The application is accompanied by the proof of approval or approved product
labels of that reference agency.

Applications that do not fulfil the above requirements should be submitted via the
abridged route.

For details regarding PRISM submissions of variation applications, please refer to
Appendix 17 Guideline on PRISM Submission. For target processing timelines for
MIV applications, please refer to Appendix 5 Target Processing Timeline


The following points should be considered when submitting an MIV:
- If one MIV contains multiple changes that belong to both MIV-1 and MIV- 2
categories, then the MIV should be categorised as an MIV-1;
- MIV-1 changes should be grouped together as one application when these are
consequential changes;
- Non-consequential MIV-1 changes are strictly not allowed. For instance, for a
CMC MIV-1 application, MIV-1 updates to the product labelling unrelated to
CMC changes will not be accepted;
- HSA reserves the right to split unrelated consequential changes into separate
MIV application(s), if deemed necessary; and
- If a proposed MIV-2 does not meet its specified conditions, then the MIV must
be categorised as an MIV-1 with supporting documents.

HSA may re-categorise the MIV if deemed appropriate.

Applicants should ensure that all conditions and documentary requirements for the
MIV have been fulfilled prior to submission. For an MIV with multiple variations, all
of the requirements for each individual variation must be met.

Applicants are strongly encouraged to submit variation applications for multiple
strengths of the same therapeutic product at the same time. Applicants are also
strongly encouraged to indicate in the PRISM application form and cover letter (to
be attached under “Introduction” in PRISM) if the proposed change(s) affect multiple
products and if there are other pending variation (MAV/MIV) applications for the
same therapeutic product.

Any undisclosed variation(s) embedded in the submitted data, including any flow-
on changes, will not be considered. Evaluation will be based on the data relevant
to the proposed variation(s), unless HSA specifically requests for additional
information.

```
NOTE: Applicants are encouraged to submit the MIV Filing and Submission Enquiry
Form in Appendix 12 if there are any issues regarding the categorisation of variation
applications.
```

It is the applicant’s responsibility to ensure the completeness of the dossier and
compliance with all specified requirements – failure to do so may delay the MIV
review process.

No further changes to the application are allowed after submission in order to
facilitate the timely processing of all applications, with the exception of HSA-initiated
safety related changes.

For each product registration, applicants may submit up to a maximum of five
concurrent MIV-1 applications and one MIV-2 application at any one time.
